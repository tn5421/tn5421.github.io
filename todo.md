# Urgent Priorities

1. De-duplicate the navigation bar as much as possible to save on space.  This can most likely be accomplished by making said menus collapsible and uncollapsing the relevant section via context.
2. Streamline and remove redundant categories (to be archived).
3. Make my simpler python scripts available via my homepage.

# Would like to have

1. No more content-less pages or placeholders...or at least, better placeholders.
2. Collaboration with other members of the communities I'm a part of.
3. Make as many links as possible relative for easier local testing.
