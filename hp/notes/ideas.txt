Track AP costs of virus installs (uncertain)Transfer Guide - track speed at which software can be transferred based on max available bw


Capture Calculator - 
Minimum time for capture is 75 seconds per 1 Megabyte. If virus version is higher then Virus Breaker version, capture modifier comes into play: captureModifier = 1 + virusVersion - breakerVersion; Modifier is then multiplied by the default time to determine the new time.
Time for capture can not go below default time (75 sec for each 1 Mb). What this means is if the Breaker version is equal or more then the virus version you get the best time (75 for 1 Mb), if the virus is higher you get increasingly worse time.
