				<p>This was my first game of mafia on mafiascum as well as my first game of mafia ever.  I replaced in on page 8 of 38.  Misread Charlie and helped to lynch day one.  Floundered around for a bit on day 2 before	 attempting to push an Android lynch, and eating a lynch because of it.  Town won somehow.</p>
