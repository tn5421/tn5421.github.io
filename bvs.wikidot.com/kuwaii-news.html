<p>Today with 11 Surprise tons of orders at the store, as well as having to plan the summer's weekly mahjong meetups amongst everyone's new schedules ate into time today, so very little BvS done. Did eat some good BBQ while sending out the Festival freebies. -11 UPDATE: While doing monthly taxes, I got a diagonal papercut on my upper lip (holding envelop in teeth while filing State Employment). It hurts when I everything. T_T UPDATE UPDATE: a cat stole my quesadilla</p>
<p>Monday 5/14 (22:27):</p>
<p>11 Daily Update Hi, ladies and gentlemen, just checking in with everyone. Finished up the last of the K-Dog sketches today, next up are.. Euthanasia and Lil' Rack, both slated to be done by tomorrow. The cats had a giant fight behind the TV today, unplugging all my internets and requiring a rewiring - those of you with jungles of video game cords know what I mean. Regarding the Notetaker test in BC, I'm not liking how it is pretty much 1v1, so it'll get worked on heavily down the line. It seems it would be much easier to just add Snakeball.<br />
The Festival winners' list is late, I thought I'd have it by today, but I don't, hopefully it'll be in tomorrow.<br />
After finishing the last major thing I had to do this season (a bachelor party and a wedding speech) I've got a lot more free time on my hands, so here's hoping things get done much faster! -eleven</p>

<p>Another excellent year! This is the big one - 11/11/11. As I lay here (having come down with some crazy thing that had me sick all last night, thank goodness for Theraflu. But seriously, I actually barfed 11 times. At 9 I was like &quot;ha ha wouldn't it be funny if I barfed 11 tiHRRRK&quot;), I think of all the things I wanted to do on 11/11/11. Originally, I wanted to launch Pirates - the second arc of the story that is BvS. But, I got too busy. So, I thought, I'll settle for releasing the Final part of the Loop Arc - The Reaper's Game - but I still didn't get there in time.</p>
<p>Boy, have I been a fail lately. -_- I've got nothing truly special pre-planned for Billy. My apologies.</p>
<p>What I will do, however, is launch a game to be played every 11th - where the top winners of it will be crowned one of The Eleven. What this actually does, I dunno yet - I still have a fever, and don't want to code while out of it, that's where weird things come from. Enjoy! -11DBHK</p>

<p>Portcon INSTA-CONTEST Okay you crazy TACOlovers, I am posting this from my phone. I am about to play a East South 30k Mahjong game with Akagi, Kaiji, and Ten cosplayers. Who do you think will win? Send an in-game message to 11DBHK with the name of the person (11, Akagi, Kaiji, Ten) and their final score (30500, 41500, etc ). NOTHING ELSE. For example, &quot;Akagi 43500&quot;. The 11 who get the winner right and the score closest without going over will get a Sho Nuff Elixir, and the closest will get an Over 11000. One entry each, no alts. Entry closes at 3P BillyTime. LET'S GET IT ON. -11 UPDATE: At the East South break, it is 11&#160;35000, Akagi 31100, Ten 27100, Kaiji 26800. MATCH RESULTS After a Haneman Reach Ippatsu Tsumo and a horrifying hidden tenpai deal into Kaiji's 3-dora near-Mangan, 11 Pulls out a win with 39000! Akagi got second with a 37800 - so close dude, maybe next year. Prizes late night tonight once I extract myself from the Rave, seriously this is the best small con I have been to in years.</p>

<p>This is a Super Special one, because it is also the grand opening of my new business, Heart of the Cards (website will fully launch on the 11th). To commemorate this, Four Custom Kaiju will be announced, the Bargletron will give everyone +300 Stamina (which means BC people get a total of +600), and for that day, all purchased Boosters that are used on the 11th count double! (HotC boosters count as purchased, and it doesn't matter when the booster was purchased. Example: you have a +10 Flow Booster you bought last month. If you use it on the 11th, you get +20 banked Flow instead of +10)<br />
So on the 11th, check out the site, maybe buy a Trial Deck at Hammergirl Anime, and have some fun!</p>

<p>HEART OF THE CARDS SUPER UPDATE<br />
Someone pointed out to me that since there was triple the response from the HotC, there should be triple the Custom Kaiju.</p>
<p>They are absolutely correct.</p>
<p>There will be three Custom Kaiju drawn.</p>

<p>HEART OF THE CARDS UPDATE<br />
Hey, all. Still at a convention (actually back from the con for the night, in that downtime when I'm too wired to go to bed, but really should because I have to be up at what-the-heck-o'clock). Wanted to give you the lowdown on HotC.</p>
<p>Good News: The goal of 200 HotC was reached!<br />
Better News: It was more than doubled!<br />
Disturbing but still Better News: It was more than TRIPLED.</p>
<p>What.</p>
<p>I had no idea so many people would buy multiple Collections. Seriously, I'll be doing a lot of sketching. o_o I'm still trying to figure out the most cost-effective way to send everything out. First and foremost: thank you. You rule. Second, this has allowed us to get some really good shipping rates with the bulk, and the extra funds have kept me from having to take out a loan to do this - giving the business a 'buffer' that will allow it to take the time and do the launch right.</p>
<p>It'll be cool, though, I planned for this contingency, and made sure I could keep up the pace. Once these cons are done, it's on.</p>
<p>I'll be leaving the HotC up for a few more days so stragglers can get in. After that, the purchase menu will go down, but the activate / change menus will be available while people's stuffs go through.</p>
<p>Okay, 600 sketches aside - update on the licensing thing. WS people of the US, this is the info you want to read.</p>
<p>We'll be getting our first shipment in about a week + customs, and it should be of a few key series that are the easiest to get into / popular in America. It won't be for sale right away, because we have multiple shipments to do, and we're working out the kinks in the travel time and cost. The other stuff that we can get will hopefully be shipping shortly after that, but I've got some logistical hurdles to get through first. I can't talk too much about specifics here, just because things still need to be signed / priced.</p>
<p>A new website is in the making for the distribution, and the first vendor will be (of course) Hammergirl Anime. They'll be offering all of Cardfight!! Vanguard on launch, as well as a bunch of WS stuff. Which sets is still a little up in the air, and if I have to postpone the website for a week to, say, land Nanoha or Fairy Tail, I will.</p>
<p>We should be able to redeem promotional materials - no promises yet, but it is looking good. There will be Organized Play, the full official manuals (not just the quick manuals), and full translation (of at least everything we carry, if not everything).</p>
<p>Hammergirl Pricing: Pricing is going to be loosely tied to the Japanese Yen. That way, if the Yen's changing makes things less expensive, we can Pass The Savings On To You.</p>
<p>The prices will be such that, after shipping, they are the cheapest out there - while some other sites may have slightly cheaper cards, they have crazy expensive shipping for just one/two boxes, and if you buy a bunch, Hammergirl's $5 flat shipping for the whole order becomes extra awesome. tldr getting them to your door will be cheaper than anywhere else that's reliable right now, and on top of that will get there via Priority Mail, not When Is The Boat Getting Here mail. Other stores that were interested, we'll be in touch soon.</p>
<p>So yeah, much more to come once the website is up. I couldn't have done it without all of you, and things are looking really, really good. Once the original setup is complete, the store will integrate seamlessly into the current store's shipping department, and won't take up any significant additional time - Except that now, there are awesome card games in the US that have never been here before. Awesome.</p>
