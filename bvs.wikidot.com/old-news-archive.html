<p>Another excellent year! This is the big one - 11/11/11. As I lay here (having come down with some crazy thing that had me sick all last night, thank goodness for Theraflu. But seriously, I actually barfed 11 times. At 9 I was like &quot;ha ha wouldn't it be funny if I barfed 11 tiHRRRK&quot;), I think of all the things I wanted to do on 11/11/11. Originally, I wanted to launch Pirates - the second arc of the story that is BvS. But, I got too busy. So, I thought, I'll settle for releasing the Final part of the Loop Arc - The Reaper's Game - but I still didn't get there in time.</p>
<p>Boy, have I been a fail lately. -_- I've got nothing truly special pre-planned for Billy. My apologies.</p>
<p>What I will do, however, is launch a game to be played every 11th - where the top winners of it will be crowned one of The Eleven. What this actually does, I dunno yet - I still have a fever, and don't want to code while out of it, that's where weird things come from. Enjoy! -11DBHK</p>

<p>Player Kaiju may now transfer Leadership in their Immortal Realms. Here's the rules:<br />
- you can only give it to someone who has obtained The Sky Will Strike (Protagonist Rank)<br />
- you cannot leave a Village you've created without being the last one (destroying it)<br />
- you may always take back Leadership</p>
<p>So, yeah. Woo. BR any problems, but be super-specific - this was a lot of touchups in some very old code, so there may be some issues. o_o -11</p>

<td>Solatorobo out in the West! FREE STUFFS TIME
<div class="image-container aligncenter"><img src="http://bvs.wdfiles.com/local--files/old-news-archive/solalogo.jpg" alt="solalogo.jpg" class="image" /></div>
<p>So, folks, let me tell you about one of my favorite companies. CyberConnect2 brought us .hack, which you probably have heard of, but about 11 years ago they brought out Tail Concerto, which is one of my favorite games. It is set (thanks to Noboteru Yuuki, excellent artist btw) in the Little Tail Bronx world, which is a happy world of robots and police dogs and other such hilarity. They also did Mamoru-kun, which was this Japanese fire prevention initiative. After all this time, there's a new game! Solatorobo is an action-adventure game on the DS, and I was so looking forward to it that I got the Limited Edition when it came out in Japan (there's a link to the Japanese site on the right side of this page - it's been there since it was announced in Japan). Well, XSeed Games brought it out over here! With all of the games we DON'T get because people suck, having this is a big deal, at least to me.</p>
<p>SO. If you buy it, and take a picture with 1. the game box, 2. The Soundtrack you get with it open up so I can see the disc and the booklet, 3. the game on your DS at any point when Red is talking to Chocolat, 4. the manual open to page 11, 5. Your Billy Name, and 6. a thumbs up (<a href="http://www.animecubed.com/billy/spoilers/solapic.jpg">here is an example</a>, I blurred some of it so people don't cheat, and I didn't do the thumbs up, but you should), and you send that pic to <span class="wiki-email">moc.liamg|oiduasvb#moc.liamg|oiduasvb</span> with the subject &quot;Solatorobo - YOURCHARACTERNAME&quot; (where YOURCHARACTERNAME is your character name, obviously) I will give you a free month of Billy Club and a Pachinko booster. No joke. Go buy it, you'll love it, and maybe cool games will continue coming out in the US. Deadline: Oct. 11.<br />
Please don't try to cheat this, that's mean. Also - XSeed has nothing to do with this promotion, they don't even know about it (unless they play Billy - Hi guys! I love you!). This is just me trying to get a few more sales for a game and company I love. -11</p>

<p>WorldKaiju Prize Balancing Prizes have been slightly shuffled and buffed, I hope people will be happy with the changes. The one prize that was significantly nerfed was the B-Class Craftworld is no longer a SNAKE Oil. Currently, that SNAKE Oil is still available as an Alt Prize, and will be until Wednesday. If you have banked Emblems, or are close to winning one, this is your chance to still get that prize.</p>

<p>New Party House Game - SUPERFAIL. Requires Dark Alleys. Come for the deceptively easy RP and Ryo, stay for the complaining about the impossible trophy that's only ten points baw baw baw. :) UPDATE: There's also a Booster for it now, it's really cheap and you get a bunch of games, will help those with low RP counts.</p>
<h2 id="toc42"><span>Wednesday 1/26 (15:16):</span></h2>
<p>Filler Themes no longer affect Dayroll Bonuses. Note that the only thing this currently matters with is that you don't get Ninja-Mas Stamina on 11/25, 10/25, and so on, and you don't get 'Ninja-Mas Season' Stamina every day (as opposed to December). This was a harder decision to make than you'd think, but it comes down to the amount of processing power required every day on every player to check if they had their themes on at Dayroll, and what day their dayroll would actually be. (Originally, bonuses were figured out for everyone at Dayroll. The new method figures them out when you first log in for the day, distributing it over the whole of the game, making nighttime lag and server strain exponentially better. Giving Village-based, Theme-based, date-based Stamina is a pain. I hope that the bonuses you are getting from Hidden HoClaus are making up for it. -11</p>

<p>Buying a Sabotage Facility now requires Elemental Beacon. A number of exploits were recently uncovered that involved jumping between tiers while Declaring, and the easiest solution to it is requiring Villages to hit the big leagues before they can do real damage.</p>
<p>Note that this leaves a short list of Villages with SaboFac that are not yet Beacon Villages. Villages that fall into this category will have their SaboFacs removed and be compensated for them later on this month (I do not wish to interrupt current 'Village relations' and seem like I am taking sides. Once they die down, I'll take care of it)</p>

For the bugged people, there is a small chance (based on when you ate your last fruit) that you can do it twice this month. Long story short: If you can do it again, go ahead, it's okay. -11</p>

<td>MAJOR GAME-WIDE CHARACTER BUFF<br />
I've been secretly thinking about this for a while, but I'm putting it in today (which means you'll feel the effects next Dayroll):
<p>All players get 100 more Stamina a day, and<br />
BillyClub members get +50 more Stamina a day (total 100).</p>
<p>The reason is both advances in codewriting to lower server load, and this 'lifts the smallest boats' when it comes to balancing the differences between low and high level characters - now top tier folks get 15x as much Stamina as new players instead of x30. o_o In addition, Karma Stamina Booster amounts are being tweaked. Consider it an early BillyMas present or something. :) -11</p>

<td>It's time once again for the Custom Kaiju Charity Auction!
<p>The RIT Anime Club does charity auctions around the holiday season, and I've been the MC, and the store - and now Billy - donate to it because RIT Anime Club is awesome, and I would have never gotten into anime if not for them (and Fanboy, the guy who pretty much busted down my dorm door as a total stranger and was all YOU WILL COME WITH ME TO ANIME CLUB when I had no idea what anime even was, but that is another story).</p>
<p>ANYWAY, this year, the charity is the<br />
Best Friends Animal Society. They work to make shelters in the United States into 'no-kill' animal shelters, which is like the best thing ever. They've been on a bunch of shows, and they do really good work, and I loves them. This is a PUPPY AND KITTY CHARITY AUCTION, so you just gotta bid, you know?</p>
<p>Okay, so, here is the deal. Send your HIGHEST BID to <span class="wiki-email">moc.liamg|oiduasvb#moc.liamg|oiduasvb</span> with the Subject &quot;BvS Charity Auction - Your Character Name - Your Bid&quot; (example: &quot;BvS Charity Auction - 11DBHK - $50&quot;). Minimum bid right now is $1000. Whoa. Still, multiple confirmed bids at $1K, so that is where we are starting. o_o I will update the minimum bid to stay in the running in the news here (generally, it'll be enough to get you into the top 3), and December 12th (when I find out the day of the auction this will be updated) I'll contact the highest X bidders and have a live bid-off December 16th at around 7PM BillyTime.</p>
<p>You can group up as a bidding force, you can go it alone, whatever you want to do, as long as the lead bid is under one character name. (The actual Kaiju can have a different name, as long as it is approved).</p>
<p>So, get to bidding! It's for puppies and kitties, so it's the best!</p>

<p>Glowslinging Update - the unlock for Glowslinging will be live this weekend, but not quite Glowslinging yet. Expect that NEXT week, I want to drop some art into it before it launches, I need to draw me some Lil' Ro. :)</p>
<p>So, if you do open it up at BillyCon, you'll have to wait a day or two. Things you'll need for the first half of the unlock at the Idol: Rising Star, Mr. Smith, and having been to Raging Passionate Melody. The second half needs The Glow (boo) OR the Glowslinger effect (yay). See you soon! -11</p>

<td>SURPRISE CONTEST - Epic Audio Scavenger Hunt<br />
Okay, story time.
<p>I have this game at my store. It is called Deathsmiles. In the first stage's opening music, there is a quote mixed into the music:</p>
<p>&quot;The mind of man rests on a delicate balance between reality - the world of light, and the other darker world below the threshold of consciousness&#8230; and it is from this world of darkness which comes the evil destructive forces in man's nature.&quot;</p>
<p>You can hear it here.</p>
<p>This quote has been used in other games, and by other bands, from Pump's Banya - Naissance to some metal band (here) to some other metal band (here) to Red Alert 2 (2 minutes in).</p>
<p>(Update: I've made a Youtube video with all the info and clips more clearly, if you want. Link is here)</p>
<p>I remember hearing this quote as a small child. I cannot remember where. It has haunted me for a long, long time. No one - not those bands, not AKSYS OR CAVE THEMSELVES, can tell me where it is from. Search the internet for it, and you'll find, well, ME, or a friend of mine, asking people what it is from. Nobody knows. I've been looking and asking for YEARS, scouring old 50's / 60's horror films, TV shows, everything. There is a second half to the quote, although not used in Deathsmiles: &quot;Have we seen the actual reality of a monstrous crime, or merely an illusion, the product of a tortured brain?&quot;</p>
<p>Just today, I found a band - a Norwegian band, from over a decade ago - that samples it so clearly, you can hear the music from whatever it is originally from in the clip: here. AGH. So, having failed for Over 1100 days of searching, I come to you, Oh Billy Players.</p>
<p>Find the true origin of this quote, and I'll give you a Custom Kaiju. Don't want one? Already have one? Name your price. Custom Item? Ally? Five thousand Karma? Artwork? Party House game? If I can feasibly do it without hurting the game or myself, it's done. I will come up with something, and shout your name to the heavens.</p>
<p>Normally, I don't do this sort of thing, but I have a resource - the thousands of BvS players - and I'm going to use it.</p>
<p>If you can confirm what it is from - not 'lol I read on teh internets its from a car comershul', but you have the media, or a link to a recording of the media, that I can confirm, Email <span class="wiki-email">moc.liamg|oiduasvb#moc.liamg|oiduasvb</span> that you found it, and I will contact you via email. DO NOT JUST BR or EMAIL IDEAS OR SUGGESTIONS OR MAYBES. Use the forum for that. Find the actual quote / evidence FIRST.</p>
<p>&quot;it is kinda like this&quot; / &quot;maybe it is this&quot; is NOT any help, it is just more red herrings for me to chase. Do NOT send a BR or Email saying what it 'sounds like it is from' or 'is similar to' or that 'you read the answer is whatever'. Only email if you can go &quot;11, here is a link to the exact audio, I recorded it myself&quot; or &quot;it is from episode XX of Tales, the opening, I am absolutely sure, and not jsut repeating what i read on the internet&quot; or the like. I've gotten FIFTY BRs that break these rules already ('its teh twilight zones' - okay, then from what episode? 'its like its from tales of the darkside' - but is it? 'the quote means you need to eat a taco' - what?), and I'm going to shut this down if you cannot follow directions.</p>
<p>If I don't reply in 24 hours, then re-BR - I don't want to miss out on this because you checked a box wrong. Again, make sure you are sure. If people want to do this as a group, more power to you. Don't know? Ask your mom or dad. Ask your friends. Play them that last clip I linked. It'll take you like a few seconds.</p>
<p>I know this is a little weird, but every time someone drops a quarter in the game at the store, it mocks me. Help me, BvS, you're my only hope. -11</p>

<p>Just as a random informal game review, any of you playing the Aksys DS game '999' yet? It is CRAZY AWESOME. I'm totally sucked in, I even got me one of the replica watches for it. It's like Saw meets Septentrion meets Battle Royale. I wasn't paid or asked to do this or anything, I just popped it in and it has had me on the edge of my seat for hours (and the game says you only get nine of them, so yikes amirite). For the record, yay for Clover, gotta love that puffy hair! UPDATE: o_o whoa this game is even cooler than I thought</p>
<h2 id="toc62"><span>November 18, 2010</span></h2>
<p>GOOOOOOOOOOOOOLD I got into GOLD LEAGUE in STARCRAFT 2 (I really suck at Starcraft 2, so this is a big deal for me) I'm in the semi-reputable Rimes Gamma League (at RANK SIX BOYYEEEE AWWW YEAH), EVERYONE GETS THEYSELVES A GAMMA RHYME (Check your Change Info page!) -11<br />

<p><strong>MJ BUG 1 AND 2 FIXED</strong> Special thanks to <strong>DTC</strong> and <strong>GPMC47alt</strong>, who is awesome for helping out with the perfect two screenshots and bug report.<br />
The cause, for those who care: Right or Left Chi/Pon a tile. They then switch their playstyle based on their hand, pick a discard, and discard it. if you switched your playstyle, however, it did not skip the &quot;chance to just discard the tile you drew&quot; that the early level L and R have, and rolled that. if it hit it, after a chi or pon, it would discard what it drew - and since it -drew- nothing, it would discard the tile at the 0 index - the 1 man. so it would have -1&#160;1 man in hand. so it wouldn't put it in their discard, but it WOULD tell you you could take it - thereby borking the hand. <strong>SOLUTION'D</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="toc66"><span>April 18, 2010</span></h2>
<p><strong>KNOWN MAHJONG BUGS UPDATE:</strong> If you get one of the two known Mahjong Bugs below, do the following:<br />
<strong>Ghostly 1-Man Bug:</strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Hit BACK until you get to the page it first asked you to Pon it. it will have the AI's moves on the left (&quot;discarded X from hand, etc&quot;). Screenshot that, and the page before it.</span><em>Found by <strong>DTC!</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><strong>Too Many Tiles post-Kan bug:</strong><br />
Hit BACK until you get to the page the AI first Kanned on top of their Pon (this is the only time the bug manifests itself). Screenshot that, and the page before it.</span><em>Found by <strong>GPMC47alt!</strong></em></p>
<p>Then, BR it, with links to your screenshots (use imgur or something to host it), and LEAVE YOUR MJ GAME BE. Go play somewhere else in Billy. I'll look at it in great detail. You will be reimbursed the MJ games you missed.<br />
<strong>Should your report be the one that solves either bug, you'll get an Over 11000 and 100 Karma.</strong> I simply canNOT repeat this bug myself or with playtesters, and need to find out how it is happening. So, I need your help. Thanks in advance.</p>
<h2 id="toc67"><span>April 17, 2010</span></h2>
<p><strong>KNOWN MAHJONG BUGS</strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">1. Sometimes it will ask you to 'Pon a 1 Man', when none has been discarded. Trying to do so won't work. Just pass on it.<br />
2. When an AI Selfkans an already-ponned tile, they discard yet another of that tile (which makes 5) and one more is put into the deck (which makes 6). o_o This is a weird bug, I know, but I'm unable to work on it for 24-48 hours, and it only seems to come up once in every 400-500 matches, and doesn't break the game.</span><br />
Fixes on both in progess - I'm crazy busy, so I can't just bang out a fix right now.</p>

<p><strong>MAHJONG IS GO!</strong> Okay, folks, all villages with a Temple can now play Mahjong, with Trophies, Allies, and more!<br />
Mahjong is kinda complicated, so if you don't want to learn how to play, here's the 'how to skip MJ' strat:<br />
1. Buy Swallow Switch on the MJ page ('Skip the Training')<br />
2. Use it in the lowest difficulty level to get XP<br />
3. Pay Off the allies so they join you<br />
11. MJ allies don't Loop, so be careful</p>
<p>Also: Mahjong is really complex coding-wise, so there might be some bugs / exploits kicking around. You get crazy rewards for being the person who finds them and BRs them, so feel free.</p>
<p>Also Also: <strong>DO NOT BR MAHJONG PROBLEMS</strong>. Too often it is user error (inability to count Yaku). USE THE FORUM. Make sure you READ THE MANUAL FIRST. Cool? cool. Enjoy one of my favorite games, against a host of Billyfolks, old and new!</p>

<p><strong>New Type of BvS Currency!</strong> You may now acquire a currency similar to Ryo called <strong><em>Resource Points</em></strong>.

(no, they can't be traded yet, nor can turn them back into Resources)<br />
Vices can be locked to the number of Resources they can 'crack' per day - it is set to 0 for vices now, until the leaders get to them. Currently, you can't use them to buy anything, so you probably shouldn't bug your Leader. -_-<br />
This will give a non-grindable way to pay for nifty new things.</p>

<p><strong>Cave Story coming to WiiWare Monday<br />
BUY IT AND GET FREE BILLY STUFFS</strong><br />
1. I love Cave Story. It is the best ever.<br />
2. I want it to do really well. It's everything that is good about video games.<br />
3. So <strong>if you buy it</strong>, and <strong>a picture of the main guy standing to the right of Egg #1 in the new graphics with you giving a thumbs up (i don't need your face, just the thumbs up and the pic)</strong>, and then <strong>send that picture and info to <span class="wiki-email">moc.liamG|yrotSevaCSvB#moc.liamG|yrotSevaCSvB</span> Subject: Cave Story (YOURBVSNAME)</strong>,<br />
11. I will give you <strong>3 +200 Stamina Boosters</strong> and <strong>a Cave Puppy Pet</strong> (once Houses and Pets are released).<br />
Honestly, if you only had enough money for Cave Story or Billy this month, I'd want you to buy Cave Story. It's a great game, with a great story, and great characters, and it deserves it. This deal will go until <strong>March 30th</strong>. Bonuses will be handed out after then.<br />
<span style="font-size:9px">Please actually buy the game - don't cheat or lie, or fake a screenshot from a Youtube video - you'll get banned. That would suck. The Cave Puppy is available in Houses anyway, just not right away, so this isn't worth possibly getting banned over. This is not an ad campaign or anything, I just Love The Cave Story - I played it all the time while working on what eventually became BvS. :)</span></p>

I am SUPER PROUD of the AI on this, it's got difficulty sliders, special powers, different strategies, evolving playstyles, aw yeah. Three games a day while I work out the kinks. Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>As a personal note to those people with a PS3</strong>, The Playstation 1 game <strong>Grandia</strong> just became available for download in the PS1 Classics section.</p>
<p>Grandia is, far and away, my favorite game. If you are looking for an RPG to play, GET IT. It is the best game I've ever played, and that's a lot of games. o_o I'm not being paid for this or anything, I'm just giving props to my favorite game ever. I'm PLAYING IT RIGHT NOW IT IS SO SO GOOD AAAH <em>-11</em></p>

<p><strong>Billy Club Folks</strong> can now do <strong>Item Lookups!</strong> See how many of something exist! see what percentages of players in each Season have it! (Once per week)</p>
<p><strong>Auto-Accepting Apps</strong> for villages is on its way. Currently, you can set it when you set your text, but it doesn't do anything. should be fully in by tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Quickteams</strong> now accept incorrectly-leveled Allies.</p>
<p><strong>Jackpot will take more Ryo per pull</strong> after each 250 pulls per day (resets at Dayroll). Reasoning: Wanted to put in a PHRyo Discount Ally, couldn't due to the high return of the Jackpot. Also, multi-pulls incoming shortly.</p>
<h2 id="toc94"><span>February 16, 2010</span></h2>
<p><strong>The Black Market now won't help</strong> if your Village Contribution is over 250,000 Ryo for the day. This is to plug an infinite VRyo exploit. The player who found this was awarded an Over11K.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks to The Colbert Nation</strong> for sponsoring Billy! Check the Sponsor Items (if you have them unlocked) for a new Shiny!</p>
<p><strong>PizzaWitch Ride Bonuses on WorldKai</strong> can be used on the WorldKai from the WK menu, even if you don't have PW. This is to cover any disadvantage that players may feel from not having PW and attempting to fight WorldKai.</p>

<p><strong>TsukiBall MegaGames</strong> at Tsuki Level 20 you may now start to play games for 20x the cost/tix/items/TsukiXP. (each time is rolled separately, so if you only get 1 tsukiball, that means you rolled 20 times to get one, and only got 1 - stop sending BRs kthx)</p>

<p><strong>WorldKaiju Update</strong> (brought to you by the &quot;Give Them Enough Rope&quot; Foundation)<br />
1. Armor does not lower Ranking - hit a WK for 10K, get 10K rank, even if it has 10% Armor.<br />
11. Summoners may now <strong>Enrage</strong> their WorldKaiju when summoned - every level of Enrage gives them 25% more Armor, and +1 Emblems per Earned Rank when destroyed. Each level of Difficulty adds an additional WEEK to the penalty to the Summoner if the Kaiju is not destroyed. o_o Check yourself before you wreck yourself..</p>
<p><strong>Regarding the lack of Free-For-All WorldKai</strong> - I'm looking into possible options. You'll hear more later on today. <em>-11</em></p>
<h2 id="toc102"><span>January 26, 2010</span></h2>
<p><strong>Science 5 Fixed (again)</strong> - Villages after the Tuesday Morning Dayroll that were affected in the past few days will be getting refunds + kai bonuses. <strong>Update:</strong> Bonuses given, also combo-joining bug in WK fixed. Also, there is a quest that requires 500+ WK swings: those weren't counted right away, so you might need a few more than it says. check your WK page to see the current count.</p>
<h2 id="toc103"><span>January 24, 2010</span></h2>
<p><strong>How to get Good Boy 3 is being changed</strong>, as testing has shown that the original way (beat a diff 6+ synch) is too rare a window. For the new way, if it requires a 'counter' of something, previous things that would have 'counted' towards it won't 'count', so don't BR if you already did whatever it is 2x, and it needs 10x, and you don't get it until 12x. -_-<br />
On a completely different note, it now shows the total of swings ever when you attack, and the counting of that number was not done correctly until right now, so don't BR it.</p>
<p><strong>Two things (WorldKai and Mahjong)</strong> - first, you shouldn't be able to join more than one Combo a day, that's a bug, it'll be fixed ASAP.<br />
Second, I'm thinking of taking a couple weeks of HPW / housingcode break from Billy proper while I work on the How to Play, so I'm looking for something to code for fun (and then put into Billy, of course, like Roulette and Tsukiball were). <strong>How about a one-player Mahjong?</strong> All my buddies and I play it, and it might be fun to put into the game. No multiplayer, because that is hard - just you versus Billy peeps. TALK ABOUT IT IF YOU WANT IT (in the General Forums)</p>
<h2 id="toc104"><span>January 23, 2010</span></h2>
<p><strong>Congrats to Quetz</strong> on defeating the first WorldKai! So you folks know, you were supposed to get <strong>two</strong> emblems of each rank for being in the top 11, it only gave you one. I'm fixing that now..</p>
<h2 id="toc105"><span>January 22, 2010</span></h2>
<p><strong>Leader Change Max</strong> You may now only change Leadership in Villages up to three times per day.</p>

<p><strong>Unexpected Downtime</strong> - the server was down for abotu 1.5-2hrs from 11PM to 1A Billytime. Reason: Failboats. Resolution: Failboats launched into sun. Issues - Robo Tourneys from that time did not roll. Looking into any other errors. Please refrain from BRing anything unles it is a specific problem with your character (no &quot;hey, the server was down&quot;). Thanks for your continued support.</p>
<h2 id="toc109"><span>January 15, 2010</span></h2>
<p><strong>Arena Page changed</strong> so you don't have to scroll as much.</p>
<h2 id="toc110"><span>January 14, 2010</span></h2>
<p><strong>Due to some serious Big Board Problems</strong>, multiple players can no longer play the Board from the same IP.</p>
<p><strong>Tiny Bee Update!</strong> First, you can no longer use S Rank parts in the FKF. The reason?</p>
<p><strong>You can now have more than one Tiny Bee Weapon!</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the Sponsor Items, you can 'drop them at the bank', then go hunting for another one. Now, if you are in the RF for a 2.0, and you've banked a 2.0, it still won't let you, but if you, say, have a Rifle, and want to try for a 2.0, you can put away the Rifle while you go 2.0 hunting. :)</p>

<p><strong>New Free Shinies - Sponsored Items!</strong> A number of people and one business (which I own &gt;_&gt;) have been looking for a way to 'support' BvS in a permanent way - sort of like how companies have advertised on here.</p>
<p>Now, this led to a quandry - how do I reward them for supporting the game, but not in a game-breaking or unfair way?</p>
<p>So, now, we have <strong>Sponsored Items</strong>. They don't get them - you do! Here's how it works:</p>
<p>- Sponsors can donate to put an item onto the Shelf of Sponsor Items. They name it and pick from a list of bonuses that the item can have.<br />
- Once you hit Season 3, you'll see a link on your Main Page to the Sponsored Item Page, and there you can take <strong>one</strong> of these items. If you want to take another one, you have to put the first one back.</p>
<p>See, I was going to put in a crazy grindy item that you can shake and change into different bonuses, but I figure, why not just put it in this way, that way people can, if they want, become a permanent part of the BvS world. cool, right?<br />
Even if there are a bunch of items, since you can only have one at a time, it won't get out of hand, and the list of bonuses are pre-balanced, so no item will be more crazy than any other. This'll unlock later on tonight, once the bugs are worked out. I also have to hash the exact method you can become a Sponsor - although, we already have our first one - <strong>Dresden</strong>! Thanks, Dres, for helping out the game, especially when I had to just recently pay for a bandwidth upgrade. -_-</p>
<p>Stay Tuned for more info!</p>
<h2 id="toc123"><span>December 12, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Bit Shop 2 is Open</strong> if you know where to find it and who to bring with you. Props to <strong>poleritude</strong> for the complete writeup and balancing (other than the last ability, which I totally beefed up for the hilarity).</p>
<p><strong>Ingredient Collecting is now easier</strong> - Trailmix stacks, and you can use it all at once (and buy it at 10x)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Sandman Lvl. 2</strong> now quadruples your Summon Timer, rather than give you unlimited use. Reason: Made summons too hard to balance, so it is this or severely nerf all future Summons.</p>

<p><strong>There is a New Referral Booster</strong> available in the Karma section, for those who are attempting and having trouble getting referrals. Funds from the Referral Booster will be used to promote BvS - it was just getting too hard for people to go out and refer their game on their own, and as the advertising campaign is starting up, this is a good way for people to 'help out' without having to do the legwork.</p>
<h2 id="toc126"><span>December 4, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>New Robo Fighto Tourney</strong> for a plot-related Part. Don't baw if you think it stinks, it'll come in handy later. Also, yes, it is crazy expensive to play, but you only need it once, and you won't need it for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Best. Spoiler. Ever.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fun Hint for High-Level Players:</strong> Start saving up now for the Festival, because once PizzaWitch launches, the Sho 'Nuff will be considered a 'required' item (as in, I won't feel bad if I lock high-level content away from those who don't have it). Note that I said Elixir, not Glow.</p>
<p><strong>New Booster in Karma Section:</strong> Although I wouldn't use it if I were you, since it won't help you.. yet.</p>
<h2 id="toc127"><span>December 2, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Four new Hyper-Rare Runes are available!</strong> These cannot currently be used for anything, but are essential to make the highest levels of PizzaWitch gear. Just want to give some of you people Something To Do(TM).</p>
<p><strong>New Ramen</strong> that you high-end players may want to start using &gt;_&gt;</p>
<h2 id="toc128"><span>December 1, 2009</span></h2>

<p><strong>Two Trade-Between-Player Things:</strong> first, you no longer need AA Spray to get to the Bucket Trade menu, and second, you can now send Ryo directly via that menu. Be sure to read the rules there first, so you don't get yourself banned.</p>

<p><strong>People fighting / corrupted by Phases</strong> but without access to a Chaos Gate can take care of business on the Kaiju page (so they can get back to Kaiju-fightin').</p>
<p><span style="font-size:20px">Festival Results!</span></p>
<p>The Marksman results are on the PH (someone got within a BILLIONTH of a Billy, that is CRAZY)!<br />
Here's the winners of the raffle, fresh off the mail:</p>
<p><strong>Brutal Legend (360 or PS3, your pick):</strong> poleritude<br />
<strong>Half-Minute Hero on the PSP:</strong> Hamstaro<br />
<strong>Retro Game Challenge - DS:</strong> Rahvin<br />
<strong>Autographed sketch of your choice of Ally:</strong> Kotone An<br />
<strong>Autographed sketch of your character:</strong> McSmashy<br />
<strong>Custom Kaiju:</strong> MageOhki<br />
<strong>One Year of Billy Club:</strong> McCabe<br />
<strong>Five Awesome Manga:</strong> Furenzoku<br />
<strong>Left 4 Dead 2 on Steam (PC):</strong> Houshin23</p>
<p>I was actually surprised at two things: 1. the number of old-timers that won, but that is the RNG, I guess, and 2. how few people entered the games / sketches raffles. Less than 20% of you put a ticket into anything but the Custom Kai and the Year of BC. They will be contacted later on today! Yay! See you all next month!</p>

<p><strong>Pre-11/11 Festival Announcement</strong> This space reserved for EPIC 11/11 announcement, probably coming tonight or tomorrow..</p>
<p><strong>Putting PW on hold for a few days</strong> so I can come up with some 11/11 celebrations. :)</p>
<h2 id="toc139"><span>November 6, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Power of Greass Rewrite</strong> Here's the new text:<br />
&quot;Gives a Range and Level bonus equal to your Crank, and get any available Items / Allies / Events possible if you win the Mission.</p>
<p>Works <strong>once a day, only once per Mission per Season, uses all Stamina</strong>.&quot;<br />
Note the once-a-day limit, and also - using it on a MegaMission costs 10 uses.</p>
<p><strong>Power of Greass is being changed again</strong>, stay tuned for updates..</p>
<p><strong>Power of Greass Change</strong> - it now gives you more things from the mission - Items, Allies (not Levelups, just Allies), <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Ally Drops</span>, Events. However, it no longer auto-passes the mission for you. (update: Ally Drops? That wasn't supposed to be there. Blame it on coding before the morning soda..) You have to beat the mission yourself. <strong>Also</strong>, Billy can only auto-win on missions of 100 Diff or less.</p>
<h2 id="toc140"><span>November 5, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Leaders who don't have access to the Leader Forum</strong> can check their Change Options page to get themselves access.</p>
<h2 id="toc141"><span>November 2, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Fireworks</strong> will not be able to be used if you have zero or less Stamina. This means that if you fire off a ton of them, and your stamina drops to zero, the rest won't go off. <strong>Minor Update:</strong> Stamina loss from the Kunai is down to 5, not 10.</p>
<p><strong>PizzaWitch super-high level content</strong> (which unlocks once you've beaten it both possible ways) will not be releasing with PizzaWitch, so I can get thhis out the door faster. It will probably be in by the time anyone actually gets to it, but I wanted to be up-front with all my Ninjas. -11</p>
<h2 id="toc142"><span>November 1, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Clearing up a few Fireworks BRs</strong> - Guy Fawkes Day is in November, and so the shop sells Dangerous Fireworks for the month of November, too. Consider it a shout-out to the surprising number of BvS players we have 'across the pond'. :)</p>

<p><strong>Kaiju Phase Fighting Change</strong> - If in the middle of fighting a Phase, or Corrupted by fighting one, you will be unable to fight a regular in-village Kaiju. Change goes into effect Monday-ish.</p>
<p><strong>Upcoming Content Props - Catboy, Starfyre and Borrie</strong> inadvertently gave me a great content idea. Props to them. They'll be getting the Step One of it a bit early. :)</p>

<div class="image-container aligncenter"><img src="http://bvs.wdfiles.com/local--files/old-news-archive/pwspoilerc.jpg" alt="pwspoilerc.jpg" class="image" /></div>
<p><strong>Quickteams Upgrade 2</strong>: You can now name your quickteams and reorganize them slightly.</p>
<h2 id="toc145"><span>October 29, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Moar Quickteams at Higher Seasons</strong> (10 at S2, 20 at S3)</p>
<p><strong>Flying Thunder God Technique</strong> is being changed slightly. The change has no effect on the game.. for now. *ominous music*</p>
<h2 id="toc146"><span>October 22, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>HAPPY CAPSLOCK DAY</strong> *KICKS THE QUEST CODE* *KICKS IT AGAIN* <strong>THERE WE GO</strong></p>
<h2 id="toc147"><span>October 15, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Thin View</strong> in the Robo Fighto is disabled for now. It probably isn't coming back - coding the same thing for two pages is a bit much. The current 'normal' view will eventually have a 'thin view' of its own. (update: fixed)</p>
<p><strong>Milling Contracts</strong> now gives a summary, nto a description of each.</p>
<h2 id="toc148"><span>October 12, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>The Five Rings</strong> is now required to start a Village.</p>
<h2 id="toc149"><span>October 11, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>It Appears one of our ad providers</strong> is being a fail. I'm working on it right now.. -_-</p>
<h2 id="toc150"><span>October 9, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>New 5-Point Trophy</strong> To even things out. Tons of you probably already got it. Alsso, in a few minutes, a new Awesome Ability (the first of two) is going in.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Notes about upcoming content:</strong><br />
- It will require <strong>R00t Password</strong>.<br />
- The &quot;Reaper's Game&quot; part of it is being separated, and will not be coming out until latter.<br />
- You are strongly suggested to have a relatively high amount of GNT Range.</p>
<p><strong>PizzaWitch writing is in Overdrive</strong> hehe, 'Overdrive'. Anyway, it's turnign out to be a much bigger mission section than I originally thought, so it'll be a few more days than expected. I'm working day and night on it, though, so stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>On a COMPLETELY UNRELATED note</strong>, Players with 'Survived the Impossible' now have a once-per-Zombja Map ability. Check it out. :)</p>
<p><strong>So, if there is, say, a zombie movie in the theaters?</strong> You should see it. It is AWESOME. *codes*</p>
<p><strong>Phaseable Kaiju</strong> have started to have the problems that old pre-Recode Kaiju had - that you could fight them multiple times a day for very cheap, making getting tons of drops in a day super-easy (and unfair, for those with much less raw Stamina). Since the advent of the Marketplace, I've looked at a lot of the current systems differently, as they become money-makers. As such, <strong>Focus no longer resets on a defeated Phase</strong>, and instead resets at Dayroll, as it should have long ago.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Two-year BvS Anniversary!</strong> Been so busy , I totally missed it, and had to be reminded by a player. Thanks for playing!</p>
<h2 id="toc154"><span>October 3, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>You can now get a max of 1 Million Ranking from Parties per day</strong>:<br />
The number of heavy hitters simply paying for earlier players to max out the Ranking Lists was so much of a problem, regular players without sponsors stood no chance. Now, after a certain amount of Ryo, the playing field is equal.</p>
<h2 id="toc155"><span>October 2, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Roulette is now Season 2 only</strong>, to combat the rash of characters made just to blow everything on Roulette and feed winnings to alts. -_-</p>
<h2 id="toc156"><span>October 1, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Roulette Launches!</strong> An evil PH game becaues I'm in an Evil PH mood. Includes an evil PH Trophy and a non-evil PH ally!</p>
<p><strong>Smokebomb &quot;Nerf&quot;</strong> 500 per day use max. Shouldn't be an issue for anyone, but with MMs out now, this needs to be put in to calm down the big swings in RNG.</p>
<p><strong>MegaMissions</strong> now available! MMs are a way to grind that Stamina without taking all day. Available to S3+ Jonin+, they cost 10x the Stamina, but give 11x the rewards! If you aren't on a mission (and are an S3+ J+), you can read all about them on the Mission Select screen. Boo Server Load. Hooray MegaMissions!</p>
<p>[[collapsible show=&quot;&gt; September 2009&quot; hide=&quot;&lt; Fold&quot;]]</p>
<h2 id="toc157"><span>September 30, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Mission Event Stamina</strong> stops being given once you've received 1000 or more in a single day. This state wipes at Dayroll.</p>
<h2 id="toc158"><span>September 29, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Rocket Punched</strong> changed. Thanks to Shikima!</p>
<p><strong>Edge change</strong>: Now instead of 'extra die if roll high enough' it is now '% chance to get additional die'. Edge amounts have changed to reflect this. for example, if you had an Edge of 15, every roll has a 15% chance of giving you an extra roll. Edged rolls cannot themselves Edge out. this should handle the 'high season = Edge fails' problem in R00t.</p>
<h2 id="toc159"><span>September 28, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Drunken Fist Theme</strong> now gives +2 tolerance. Note to the BR peeps out there: if you set it on Wednesday, the tolerance applies to Wednesday drinking. so your penalty will be a little less on Thursday. Also, <strong>Big Board Prize Doubled</strong>. annnd, <strong>Scratchy Billy Bucket Prize Doubled</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, you should listen to the podcast. You'll get to play roulette early. :)</p>
<h2 id="toc160"><span>September 23, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>The non-Claymore ThreeBilly Scratch cards now give 13 Billy Buckets</strong> as the base win (so 13-26-39-Claymore). Oh, also, 100 max tix per day.</p>
<h2 id="toc161"><span>September 21, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>What is this?</strong></p>
<div class="image-container aligncenter"><img src="http://bvs.wdfiles.com/local--files/old-news-archive/roul.jpg" alt="roul.jpg" class="image" /></div>
<p>Is this a pen?</p>
<h2 id="toc162"><span>September 20, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Potions</strong> are now 'Consumables', in the minimenu.</p>
<h2 id="toc163"><span>September 19, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>New Main Page</strong> - (kind of) the code for the Main Page was changed - little things like putting the potions on a different menu, etc. BR anything that seems broken, but be intelligent in your BRs.</p>
<h2 id="toc164"><span>September 18, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>We're working on that bad ad</strong>, have no fear. If this keeps up, we're dropping the network it comes from - they are supposed to be very reliable..</p>
<p><strong>Wandering Phases</strong> now A: wander at dayroll not midnight, and B: take two dayrolls to switch, so you can plan. There.</p>
<h2 id="toc165"><span>September 17, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Quick Playerbase love</strong> - Kaiju now only cost one home advanced Res to phase. Silver-Eyed pops at 10 claymore activations, not 20. All glory to the Hypnotoad.</p>
<p><strong>Compressors are being changed:</strong> It now costs <strong>one more of each basic resource</strong>* to make a non-native advanced resource.</p>
<p><strong>Phases can now 'Wander'</strong> - one phaseable monster is now always available from the Phase menu for 300 stamina. The Kaiju changes at midnight.</p>
<h2 id="toc166"><span>September 16, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Spies that have been around for more than 14 Days</strong> now have an unavoidable 10% chance to get found. This is so never-used spies will 'drop off' the list, and allow for fresh ones to be placed.</p>
<h2 id="toc167"><span>September 13, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>The Daily Bonus has changed</strong>.<br />
- You get 10,000 Ryo on your 14-day.<br />
- You get 10,000 more Ryo on your 21-day (so 20K - 10 for the 14+, 10 more for the 21).<br />
- Your daycounter is no longer reset on loop.</p>
<h2 id="toc168"><span>September 12, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>To fix a Zombja Gate Issue</strong>, if the Leader is not on the map, then ANYONE can close the gate.</p>
<h2 id="toc169"><span>September 10, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Shin Goji</strong>, for his unbelievable help in growing BvS, is now also a Custom Kaiju. There, that's everyone, BACK TO THE CODE.</p>
<p><strong>Marketplace Changes</strong>: max cost-to-post is now 10K. max ask-for price is now 50 Mil.</p>
<p><strong>Dave is in</strong> as a custom Kai. That's the lot of them, now back to coding! (UPDATE: I forgot <strong>Shin Goji</strong>, whoops, he's going in too&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>Two new custom Kaiju</strong> (quite the backlog, there is still one more after this, once Dave and I work it out) - <strong>Millennium</strong> for his help in the early days of BvS, and <strong>AzoJason</strong> for winning the IM Rush!</p>
<h2 id="toc170"><span>September 9, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Vysaga</strong> gets her custom Kaiju, for her help in working on Billy. Congrats!</p>
<p><strong>New hourly item lists</strong> Below the Top Players. See who has the most stuffs!</p>
<p><strong>You can now skip the Chunin Exam</strong>. If, however, you get a perfect score (10), you get a 5-Point Trophy, so yay. All Current S5+ players just got it for free. (Update - 5 points, not 10, whoops)</p>
<h2 id="toc171"><span>September 8, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Robo</strong> now has 10 Quickbuilds, and you can move and delete them.</p>
<p><strong>New Z-Skill: Toughness and Thorough Level 5</strong> (note - all new stuffs today is due to a Billy Summit with poleritude, blame him)</p>
<p><strong>Z-Skill Rework</strong>: Z-Skills now cost a max of 5000 ZP. People with more than 10 Level 5s just got a refund.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, for the next day or two T3 people with the drop may still get the drop</strong>, as Kaiju now check for the drop on creation, not on defeat. Stop BR'ing it. If you get the drop from a Kai that appeared today or sooner, though, BR away.</p>
<p><strong>Note to Leaders</strong>: Paperwork and Resupply must now be 'enabled'. Also, you need to 'allow' someone to close a Z-Gate, just like the Nuke (and they are the same permission, so someone who can do one can do the other). Nuke / Gate permissions are transferrable - if you have permission, you make give that permission to another (and giving up your own, if you are a Leader. You no longer 'lock' it, you 'give permission' to it. No more swonking the Nuke or the Gate from your fellow villagers like a fail)</p>
<h2 id="toc172"><span>September 6, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Oh snap you know this track is fly</strong> Tier 3 Kaiju be coming up right the hey now. I need some sleep. Hopefully there's no bugs! -11</p>
<p><strong>CLAYMORE CHANGE</strong> It's tradable now. Heh.</p>
<h2 id="toc173"><span>September 5, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>The Tip Line</strong> is now free for Seasons 1 through 3. News will be posted when the new tipline stuff hits.</p>
<p><strong>To close a FailTactic by people</strong> who send their extra T3 drops to people, sell their current, fight for T3 points, and then win it back, <strong>whether or not Terri 3 will count your points is determined on the creation of the Kaiju</strong>, not as you fight. So, if you have a Regalia when the Riders show, Terri won't count your points even if you sell it off. I wouldn't have had to do this if it wasn't being hugely abused in some villages. The more you know.</p>
<p><strong>New Zombja Helper Stuffs</strong> you can now do a Village Action that help your fellow Village members with extra ZAP - 'Resupply'. Also, you can now 'ZTFO' from a Zombja map in case there is ever a need to completely leave a map.</p>
<p><strong>Bingo Lists are by level now</strong> - lots of little upgrades today (Vysaga / Yukio / 11 summit)</p>
<p><strong>Some items no longer count</strong> for your 'Perm Count'. They are listed in description. Notable items are personal gift items, non-Runic Wasteland items, and defunct items (like Tourney Trophies).</p>
<p><strong>CHANGEMORE</strong> Another Claymore change, and a new Bloodline has been added, on behalf of <strong>AzoJason</strong>, the winner of the IM Rush!</p>
<p><strong>Two new Upgrades</strong> that let you convert Basic Resources into Advanced and Vice Versa. This is part of an effort to get the Resources in Billy flowing faster, so that players can get to that excellent Kaiju smashing more frequently.</p>

<p><strong>Hey, kids! Know what time it is?</strong></p>
<p><strong>It's 'Change the Claymore time!'</strong></p>
<p>That's right, once again, the Claymore is being changed, a favorite pasttime in the Land of Billy. Yay! *ducks the barrage of complaints*</p>
<p><br />
<strong>New Major Village Upgrade / New Kaiju</strong> Since PW is taking longer than expected, I'm adding a new section early - the Level 3 Village. Think of it this way - pre-NRF is 1, post NRF is 2, this is 3. Villages in level 3 can't attack level 1 or 2 villages (like the NRF lock now), but the Level 3 upgrade (tentatively titled the 'Elemental Beacon') will allow you to summon new, harder Kaiju, all with new upgrades and drops - really powerful ones, if I do say so myself.<br />
The L3 Upgrade will cost a base 10 Solid Fire and 10 Unmelting Ice, and will probably go in this weekend. This seems like an impossible amount, but it is very doable for both Snake Oil hoarders, Z-Upgrade stockpiles, smart invaders, Shady Dealers, and Player Kaiju - and if you combine all of the above, it shouldn't be too hard at all.<br />
Let me give a teaser on some of the new monster drops..Max Crank +2, 2 Ramen a day (second one is more expensive), 1 free Juice above and beyond your normal cap, +10 items on Marketplace at once, +1 Drift and Drive, No ZAP cost for switching weapons, +30 Appetite&#8230; village drops.. 10% bonus on contracts, +10 Stamina for Paperwork/Repair, Inquisitions work twice as well, 2500 PHRyo, triple Black Market income, Winning a Zombja Map gives +1 ZR to all players.. there, that's enough of a spoiler for now. :)</p>

<p><strong>For his honesty in finding an Epic Level Bug</strong> (a round bout way to still get full T3 points even when you have the drop) and reporting it promptly instead of using it for personal gain, <strong>Kisame</strong> has been given a Sho Nuff and 11 BillyCon Emblems. Thank you, Kisame, for being excellent. -11</p>

<p><strong>The Mark of Eleventy Billion</strong> Has been changed a tad, and is now available in game, as opposed to by meeting me in the Billy chat.</p>

<p><strong>1. BC Members now get Referral Items!<br />
2. More Karma Options!<br />
3. Easier Karma Gifting!</strong><br />
So, Part One: Here's the deal - most everyone has already referred everybody that they know, and the whole point of Referral Items was to reward people who help the game. Well, BC members help out with the game, so why not reward them? Therefore, when you sign up for BC (or BCLite), or renew your membership (even automatically), you get <strong>1 Referral Point</strong> (now called 'Loyalty Points'). For all you current BC'ers, this is <strong>retroactive</strong>, so expect a chunk of shiny at Dayroll. Again, thank you to everyone who helps keep Billy going!</p>
<p>Part Two: now, from the 'Buy Karma' page, you can get bigger, more bang-for-your-buck values of Karma!</p>
<p>Part Three: You can now, from the Buy Karma page, simply 'trade' some of your current Karma to another player or account. This means you can, say, tip someone 5 Karma for beign an awesome villager, or buy Karma for yourself and your Alts in bulk, and distribute it as you see fit. Keen, right? Yeah, I thought so too. -11</p>
<h2 id="toc178"><span>August 25, 2009</span></h2>
<p>Hey, everyone, we're looking into signing a new advertiser, but the site's 'demographic profile' is way out of date, and I need a new one. If you want to take like a 45 second survey (age, gender, do you play games on teh interwebs), it'd really help me out. I can't give you anything for doing it (them's the rules), but thanks nonetheless.</p>
<p>To get to it, go to the main animecubed page (where you get your bonus code), and click the privacy statement/demographics link right above it. the link to the survey is in there. Thanks. <strong>-11</strong></p>

<p><strong>Begun Work on PizzaWitch</strong>, the second part of Burger Ninja. Highlights include a new mission stack, revamped Workshop combines, and a Pizza Delivery System (yet unnamed) that is in effect a turn-based shmup - Player A orders a Pizza, B takes the job, then has to deliver it by running past A's village defenses, dodging and attacking traps and nasties in order to get it there piping hot.</p>

<p><strong>Starting a new Village is about to become more difficult.</strong><br />
(6/24&#160;2PM) If you were going to start a village, and can't meet these conditions, you might want to start it sooner rather than later. Assume this is going in in a week or two.<br />
- Sannin's Premium<br />
- Tote OR Write it Down theme or My Name Is theme<br />
- Strawberry 3 OR Mister Tea 3 OR Ascension theme<br />
- Knightmare Frame<br />
- Eye of the Storm Bloodline<br />
- 250K Ryo</p>
<p>The quest that gives the Item that lets you start a Village (although it is worth doing just for the item) is going in any second (Season 2+). The 250k thing, and the 'need the item to make a village', is in two weekish.</p>
<h2 id="toc194"><span>June 23, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>6/23&#160;7P:</strong> there was 5 minutes downtime as we busted on an annoying bug. Dayroll, however, should be triple-fast now.</p>
<h2 id="toc195"><span>June 22, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>6/22 late-ish:</strong> Ads are turned off while some failadvertisers get their act together and stop letting failcompanies post failads. -Fail11</p>
<h2 id="toc196"><span>June 21, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>6/21:</strong> Due to people exploiting the Marketplace, the Mo' Money trophy and Floating on Air will be changed. Stay tuned. UPDATE: The Mo' Money trophy was not changed, but FoA now also wipes your Autobuys.</p>
<h2 id="toc197"><span>June 20, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I will tell you what, the marketplace is mad awesome. going to drop some time onto coding it up nicer so that the main game won't bork the server when they descend on it by the thousands.</p>
<h2 id="toc198"><span>June 19, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Morning Friday 6/19:</strong> Marketplace is open for BC members while I work out the kinks. Buy and sell your tradable items in the world of Billy! Expect the full launch in a week or two.</p>
<p><strong>Morning Friday 6/19:</strong> The PC has petitioned to give the 'Hard' Z-Maps more ZR, as they are really that hard. I agree. Hard maps now give 4 points, and the bonuses in them +2 ZR instead of +1. hug a PC member today.</p>
<p><strong>Early Friday 6/19:</strong> Are your Village Permissions / Robofight build blanked? You can fix them now, and it will stick. Apologies for the crap, I had to fix an exploit, and I fixed it too hard. -_q -11</p>
<p><strong>There are some Permissions / Avatar issues</strong>. We're working on them. UPDATE: They are now fixed. The Robo Fighto Build, Village Perms, and Avatar approval should now all work. The reason for this abrupt change was due to an exploit that had to be patched. Thanks for your continued support. All Villagers that updated their permissions from about 5-7P Billytime Thursday will have to reset their permissions. -_-</p>
<h2 id="toc199"><span>June 13, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>IF YOUR VILLAGE BEATS A ZOMBJA MAP TODAY</strong>, send a BR saying who closed the gate. We need to double check it.</p>
<p><strong>There was a First Loser bug</strong> that sent people a big long message. I'm working on it, no need to BR.</p>
<h2 id="toc200"><span>June 12, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>There was a Village Damage exploit</strong> that we just caught that allowed people to toss tiny amounts of Green Damage on a village without them knowing, and more importantly, without unlocking their Repair menu. This damage could build up until it took down upgrades, all without the Village ever knowing.</p>
<p>We looked into it, and <strong>over half</strong> of the villages in the game have been hit. The offender (it was all one guy) was banned, and we are in the process of fixing the hole. Once it is fixed, <strong>All Village Damage will be Wiped</strong>. UPDATE: fixed, all damage wiped.</p>
<h2 id="toc201"><span>June 6, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Invasion Defense</strong> now takes <strong>6 hours</strong> to 'start working'. This is to specifically stop people from swinging their ID to people about to attack them. ID should work against concerted attacks, not a single swing.</p>
<h2 id="toc202"><span>June 3, 2009</span></h2>
<p>The <strong>Max Push Cap</strong> for Phases (if you've gotten that far, you know what I mean) is now S8, not S11.</p>
<h2 id="toc203"><span>June 2, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Apparently, Custom Kaiju</strong> haven't been being approved. Whoops. working on that now.</p>
<h2 id="toc204"><span>May 31, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>THE FINAL COUNTDOWN HAS BEEN CHANGED</strong>. It is now two items. The new item has all of the stat bonuses (which have also changed, see the Forum for details). The current TFC is now just there to let you be a Kaiju. Everyone with TFC also has the new item.</p>

<p><strong>Yes, you are hanging out with a lot of people -</strong><br />

<p><strong>New Upgrade: Blood Altar</strong><br />
IR Leaders may, once per 3 days, receive +400 Stamina, but all of their Villagers lose 30 Stamina the next Dayroll. Perfect for those days when you absolutely need to take care of business.</p>
<h2 id="toc222"><span>April 19, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>New Upgrade: Bankium Collector</strong><br />
From the upgrade text:<br />
&quot;Bankium is a super-heavy block of Ryo that is keyed to a specific Village - once made, it cannot be stolen or removed from that Village.<br />
Bankium Bars cost 250,000 Village Ryo to make, and yield 200,000 Village Ryo when broken.<br />
Bankium Energy can only be stabilized when there is a lot of raw Bankium (Village Ryo) around, so Bankium Actions can only be performed if your Village will have at least 250,000 Village Ryo available after the Action.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="toc223"><span>April 18, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Minor Dayroll Change</strong>: Dayroll now starts about 10 minutes later than it used to (it now starts at about 5:11), so we can fit in an end-of-day Robo Tourney.</p>

<p><strong>New Super-Huge Upgrade put in!<br />
Impressive History</strong><br />
+20% Ryo on Missions<br />
Requires IR, 110 other Upgrades, and Size 55 (Yes, that means Nonjas)</p>
<p><strong>Nonjas</strong>, 'Village-fillers' that up your Village Size so your upgrades don't decay, are online! Read the instructions, you small Villages, on how to use them. (quick personal note: the time to get all tis stuff out is directly from the Billy Club stuff, which frees me up to bang out new content like this. Thanks, folks! -11)</p>
<p><strong>Referral Stamina</strong> is BACK! You can now get 5 Stamina every time someone clicks on your BvS sig / link (well, new ones, anyway). You can get up to 50 Stam a day, and we aggressively filter clickthroughs, so asking your buddies to click through for you won't work for long. Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="toc225"><span>April 15, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>Dark Hour Items</strong> can now be bought by anyone with Moon.</p>
<p><strong>You can Gift Karma now.</strong> Read the T&amp;C before you Gift.</p>
<p><strong>Note: There was a tiny exploit in the Robo Fighto.</strong> It has been fixed, and exploit scores were removed and refunded. The person who reported it, however, rather than taking advantage of it, has received a <strong>Crusader's Sword</strong> for their honesty. Thanks, dude.</p>
<p>ROBO FIGHTO is now available! higher level stuff will be added as people start playing it. NOTE: it is still new and ugly, as I figured you'd rather have it now than in a couple weeks when the art is ready. Please take any bugs to the Forum first.</p>

<p><strong>As mentioned in the forum,</strong> we will soon be offering small amounts of Stamina / AP boosting - as well as a 'Billy Club' - as a completely optional subscription service. Before anyone freaks out, please read:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Stamina you get from it is far less than the referral Stamina you could get from having friends play.</li>
<li>Stamina and bonuses given will NOT affect the player rankings, or will it be able to be used to Attack, Kaiju Fight, Hardbingo, or anything else that affects other players.</li>
<li>The reason this is happening is because BvS has just become too expensive to run the way it is running. Rather than stopping updating / shutting down, we have to go to this. We have Big Plans in store for BvS, and unfortunately, the ads alone are not cutting it.</li>

<p>More information once everything is finalized, but I want to thank everyone who plays BvS, you are all awesome. There will be <strong>NO in-game content that is limited to paid subscribers only - all of Billy is always free</strong>. The upcoming 'Billy Club' is just for people who want to support this great game. Thanks. -11</p>
<p>NOTE: if you have concerns, and/or want to talk, come to the forums and talk. just be civil. this was a really hard decision to make. Either the game stagnates with no new content, or I make a way for people to 'subscribe'.</p>
<p><strong>Village Broadcasts</strong> now leave dismissable messages on your villagers' main pages, like the '11 sez' stuffs.</p>

<p><strong>Two New Upgrades for Immortal Realms</strong>: Both to help out in R00t, and get people to join those IRs.</p>
<h2 id="toc231"><span>April 03, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>R00t IS OPEN!</strong> People in Immortal Realms might want to start saving up those Errant Bits and giving them to their Leader - one hundred of them will make everyone happy. :) READ ON:<br />
Notes: <a href="upgrade_chaos-gate.html">Chaos Gate</a></p>
<p><strong>New Attribute Bonus: EDGE</strong><br />
Edge gives you extra levels if your levels 'roll' high enough. For example: If you have a Range of 1-19, and an Edge of 2, you will get a bonus roll if you roll an 18 or 19 (the top 2, because you have 2 Edge). You can get up to FIFTY bonus dice per Edge per roll. NOTE: Edge does NOT count Strength! You need to roll that high BEFORE strength is added for it to count. Edged attempts are Italicized in the roll box.</p>
<p><strong>The Fields</strong>: The environment of the Fields changes every dayroll. Certain important Fields are static, but others shift - you'll need to work together to keep track of specific features!</p>
<p><strong>That Mission with the SYNTAX ERROR</strong> is not a bug. It's supposed to be 'cool looking'. Settle down. -_-</p>
<p><strong>To Get To The Fields</strong> you need to go through the Chaos Gate in your Village. You'll need to finish a Quest first.</p>
<h2 id="toc232"><span>April 02, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>R00t is about to open!</strong> Over the next 24 hours, you'll see Science! Machines open up, Quests, and other changes. We'll let you know when it is fully live!</p>
<p><strong>Ninja who complete The Impossible Mission may now join other villages.</strong> Ninjas who do so may NOT join a Realm, may NOT take Leadership, and may NOT Attack another Village while they are in a Village they aren't Leader of.</p>

<p><strong>IF YOU CAN READ THIS, YOU ARE ON THE NEW SERVER.</strong> Phew.</p>
<h2 id="toc240"><span>March 15, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>IF YOU CAN READ THIS, YOU ARE ON THE OLD SERVER.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE LOG OFF</strong> and come back in a few hours.</p>

<p><strong>SUNDAY IS SERVER MOVE DAY. 1P-7P BillyTime.</strong></p>
<h2 id="toc242"><span>March 12, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT SERVICE NOTE</strong>: The server is in the process of being transferred. This is NOT a quick process - the other server has to be set up, things have to be copied, and at the last moment, Billy will be turned off for a bit, transferred over, and the new server will go live. That last step might not happen for a couple weeks, and I'll let you know as far in advance as possible when it is happening.</p>
<p>Until this process is complete, <strong>no new things / non-vital bugfixes will be added to Billy</strong>. This includes playtesting, balancing, or anything else. I'll be reading BRs, but unless it is vital or an exploit, the fixing of it will be put on hold.</p>
<p>This new server is a professional-grade super server, and once installed, will change a lot with Billy - faster updates, more content, 11 times the awesome. there may be some downtime, along with 'growing pains' as billy is ramped up to use the new server. Thanks for playing, everyone, I love you :) <strong>&#8212;11DBHK</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>New Tip Line</strong> in the PH for new players - if you've been around a while, it probably won't help much -_-,</p>
<h2 id="toc245"><span>March 03, 2009</span></h2>
<p>- <strong>Check out the Forums</strong> for upcoming content spoiler pics. :)</p>
<h2 id="toc246"><span>March 02, 2009</span></h2>
<p>- <strong>Math Change for FP</strong>: instead of 75/number-of-teammates on missions, it is now 90-(15 x number-of-teammates). so it was 75/50/25, not it is 75/60/45.</p>
<p>- <strong>Shady Dealings</strong> and <strong>Kaiju Discount</strong> now cannot lower the cost of an Upgrade below one resource. First SD goes off, then Kaiju halves the rest, but you can never go below one.</p>

<p>- <strong>Spartan Battleground</strong> Now only gives 25% off Chakra. While this seems like a huge cut, it actually isn't, as the way chakra stacks, you can still get up to 75% off your jutsu costs - in the old system, they multiplied so the discounts didn't help nearly as much (if you were at, say, 50% off, and got another 10, you'd be at 45, whereas now, you are at 40)</p>

<p><strong>Game will be down from 9A to 2P BST on Sunday.</strong></p>
<h2 id="toc250"><span>February 11, 2009</span></h2>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Yes, some things changed in the game you might not like. I understand that. SOME OF THEM ARE UNINTENTIONAL. However, i am currently dealing with server issues, which trump game issues. Game issues will be addressed. They cannot be addressed right now.</p>
<p>if people disagree with the changes, however deeply, those concerns will have to wait a few days while i get this server physically under control. i thank you for your consideration - the game will be 'fixed', but only once the server is fixed.</p>
<p>Game is down for about 1 hour.</p>

<p><strong>WELCOME TO BILLY VS SNAKEMAN 2.0!</strong></p>
<p>A LOT has changed. read the incomplete list below. Note: if you see something weird, hold off on BR'ing it unless it is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. We expect about 100 BR's an hour from people. Don't be one of them if you don't need to. Read the list below, and check in the BvS forum if you have questions BEFORE sending a Bug Report.</p>
<p><strong>Changelist</strong><br />
<strong>&#8212; List by Dakralai, comments by 11 &#8212;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DAYROLL</strong> - DAYROLL IS AT 4:0-ish AM BILLY TIME.</li>
<li><strong>Free Party House Ryo</strong> - you will get free PH ryo every day for logging in. Yay.</li>
<li><strong>Trophies and Awesome</strong> - This is the acheivement system of BvS. You must go into your Trophy Room and click the 'update' button to transfer any possible trophies. Some of them you might have earned a long time ago and can't get right away because you don't have the items any more like the Tote. Don't BR that, just get it again.</li>
<li><strong>Trophy Exceptions</strong> - Eclipsed: you'll get that right away if you have Eclipsed.</li>
<li><strong>Ascension change</strong> - Ascended Leaders cannot spy or attack. They also can only be beaten if they are A: bingoed and B: invaded by someone who bingo'd them in the past hour. THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU WANT TO INVADE AN ASCENDED VILLAGE, THE SAME PERSON THAT BINGOS THEM HAS TO INVADE.</li>
<li><strong>GNT vs Dou</strong> in bonuses - If something says '+3 range', it is +3 gen nin tai. if it says +3 to all ranges, it is gen, nin, tai, dou, arr, everything. this goes for all stats.</li>
<li><strong>Level Caps</strong> - Stat caps are 20 + 2 for every season you've beaten. So, S3 players are capped at 24: 20, +2 for S1, +2 for S2. if you are capped, you gain AP like normal, but when you level up, you don't actually get a point.</li>
<li><strong>Village Headbands</strong> - Vilalge headbands must be resumitted. Your old headband can be foulnd by your Leader on your Village page. They need to save and resubmit it.</li>
<li><strong>Village Upkeep</strong> - Jonin and Sannin have HUGE upkeep costs. This means your village probably has a +100% upkeep for today. Don't complain. Loop, do Paperwork (buy Cushy Offices, srsly), or suck it up. More upkeep lowering things may be put in shortly.</li>
<li><strong>Chunin Exam</strong> - The first part of the Chunin Exam is TOTALLY DIFFERENT now, and HARD if you aren't Season 1. You have to lrn2rd and think to beat it.</li>
<li><strong>Realms</strong> - Beating the IR gets you a Key (Kaiju should know what I mean). The Key allows you to make a Realm, and uses up the key. Destroy the realm, get back the Key.</li>
<li><strong>Additive bonuses</strong> - Bonuses add, not multiply. so if you make 100 Ryo, and have a +100% bonus and +50% bonus, you end up with (100+100+50)= 250 Ryo, not (100*(1.00 + 1.00)*(1.00+0.50)) 300 Ryo.</li>
<li><strong>SBS nerf</strong> - Sight Beyond Sight may only be used once per mission per day. You may use it multiple times, but not on the same mission.</li>
<li><strong>Destiny Fulfilled Buff</strong> - Destiny Fulfilled now triples all Chakra Costs used against you in bingos.</li>
<li><strong>PH prices</strong> - Anyone can use the PH now, however, it costs them more. people in Villages with the PH upgrade get a 'discount', which brings the prices down to where they were before.</li>
<li><strong>Arena</strong> - the Arena is now what you remember as the NWW. You fight others randomly in there for reputation and awards. You USUALLY fight someone about your own level, but not always.</li>
<li><strong>Quests</strong> - Special Missions are now called Quests.</li>
<li><strong>Hairpin not giving stamina</strong> - The Blue Flower Quest now no longer gives Stamina.</li>
<li><strong>Treasure price drop</strong> - Treasure prices are slightly lower, and have a much greater chance of being 'average' than 'bad' or 'good' (think 2d10, not 1d20).</li>
<li><strong>One a day Kaiju</strong> - Kaiju ONLY GO DOWN AT DAYROLL. You cannot summon multiple ones per day. if the Kaiju is at 0HP at dayroll, it goes down,</li>
<li><strong>Negative HP Kaiju</strong> - To keep Terri 3 abusers from locking in a win on a Kaiju, you can still hit Kaiju that are at 0 hp (crippled) to get T3 points.</li>
<li><strong>Quest stamina costs</strong> - Quests now cost 10 stamina per step, not 30 per attempt.</li>
<li><strong>Allies disabling instead of leaving the party on incorrect missions</strong> - Your allies merely 'disable' instead of leave outright on missions they are not allowed in.</li>
<li><strong>Goth Goth nerf</strong> - Goth Goth adds pulls, it does not double pulls.</li>
<li><strong>Fruitbasket nerf</strong> - Fruitbasket adds pulls, it does not double pulls.</li>
<li><strong>Letter of marque parts getting a higher point cost</strong> - The Arena Items (formerly the NWW items) cost a bit more.</li>
<li><strong>No trainers</strong> - You cannot learn jutsu from allies of your villagers. you must find them on your own.</li>
<li><strong>New juice prices</strong> - Juice is generally more expensive.</li>
<li><strong>No free reaper blood change</strong> - Reaper blood costs stamina every time to change.</li>
<li><strong>Low amounts of team changes in S1</strong> - You may only change your team X Times per day. You get a bonus as S1 Genin, plus you get a bonus each season.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of strength from training schools</strong> - Training School Upgrades do all sorts of different things, from making the Chunin Exam cost less to giving stamian on missions. Read them before BRing.</li>
<li><strong>Knightmare Frame giving range (you know SOMEONE wont read the item)</strong> - The Knightmare Frame now gives +5 Dou Range / +5 Level Cap.</li>
<li><strong>AP</strong> - has changed. in some instances, you'll level right away.</li>
<li><strong>Moon not giving stat bonuses anymore</strong> - You moon gives bonuses solely in the new arena.</li>
<li><strong>Moon waning</strong> - Moons wane a single step at sunrise Billytime (7AM / 8 AM ish).</li>
<li><strong>Permanent items grouping into stacks instead of being single items</strong> - Perms stack. This means that if you have some perms above and below your lock-line, they might all now be below. check it out before BRing.</li>
<li><strong>No keg</strong> - Stamina bonuses are now once a day.</li>
<li><strong>MPH increase from 5000-7500 for a favour</strong> - 7500 MPH required for storm favor. top storm favor is gone.</li>
<li><strong>No longer lists bonuses at the bottom of the mission screen</strong> - mission screen layout is different. look it over carefully.</li>
<li>Rolls BELOW the 'next mission' button - mission screen layout is different. look it over carefully.</li>
<li><strong>Allies being included in the main menu stats</strong> - Allies, bonuses, everything is included on your mainpage character card.</li>
<li><strong>Dou levelling is different (and thus frightening)</strong> - Doujutsu now levels like any other stat - it does not have the tiny cost it used to.</li>
<li><strong>Trail mix more expensive</strong> - self-explanatory.</li>
<li><strong>Risky badge different</strong> - rixkey badge now flips a coin - half the time you do half dam, half you do double.</li>
<li><strong>Claymore epic nerf</strong> - The Claymore is now &quot;+1 Levels, 10% chance to take double the Resources when Invading&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Officers pay change</strong> - it only gives bonus once per day.</li>
<li>Pokerballs change - +25% Ally Find Chance</li>
<li><strong>Professors hat and Utility belt being moved to the party wheel</strong> - You get these by spending certain amounts on the wheel</li>
<li><strong>Yuri requires X ryo spent</strong> - she's on the wheel</li>
<li><strong>Rack requires 150K not 100K</strong> - she's on the wheel</li>
<li><strong>NWW becoming arena and not being available in the village menu</strong> - what was NWW is now 'arena', and on your minimenu</li>
<li><strong>Negative Stam and Chakra</strong> - Stamina and Chakra can go negative.</li>
<li><strong>Chakra Overload</strong> - Chakra can go over your max via methods that give you chakra other than charging.</li>
<li><strong>Low odds of finding shadow in arena</strong> - You can fight Your Shadow in the arena. it is hard to do.</li>
<li><strong>Fighting others outside your rank in the arena.</strong> - you don't always fight people of your same rank in the arena.</li>
<li><strong>Note pages give no style</strong> - Note someone, you get no style.</li>
<li><strong>Snakeman not needing outside village</strong> - You get him by being bingoed.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrades taking sabo damage if you don't have the villagers for them.</strong> - Upgrades do not Disable. Instead, if you do not have the size required, they take damage at dayroll.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrades no longer locked by size.</strong> - Upgrades require a certain number of other upgrades to buy now - not a certain village size.</li>
<li><strong>Paperwork Village Action</strong> - you may do Paperwork, which lowers your village Upkeep by 1% at Dayroll.</li>
<li><strong>Village Action stamina</strong> - village actions no longer cost stamina.</li>
<li><strong>No loop cap</strong> - You no longer have to loop. instead, your stats are capped at a certain amount, that goes up each season.</li>
<li><strong>Everyone can do all village actions</strong> - Everyone can Collect, Patrol, Repairm and Do Paperwork.</li>
<li><strong>Paperwork not taking effect the SECOND they click it.</strong> - AT DAYROLL means AT DAYROLL.</li>
<li><strong>Village remodelling being gone</strong> - You cannot remodel your village.</li>
<li><strong>Stamina favour nerf</strong> - You get less stamina from the Storm.</li>
<li><strong>Bawing about the new upgrade system and how X upgrade shouldn't be available at Y villagers but Z villagers instead</strong> - Shut up.</li>
<li><strong>The unbingo 'cooldown' period</strong> - If you use a potion to unbingo yourself, you enter 'cooldown' - and cannot attack other vilalges for X hours.</li>
<li><strong>Someone getting confused when the special mission they just failed didn't take them back to start</strong> - When you lose in a Quest, you stay at the same spot you were at. You must 'abandon' ones you want to leave.</li>
<li><strong>Moons</strong> - Your moon isn't an item. it is a stat on your Main Page.</li>
<li><strong>This hand of Mine</strong> - is considered to be a reaper jutsu.</li>
<li><strong>Themes</strong> - any theme changes you made today must be made again.</li>
<li><strong>Silver Petals</strong> - Are non tradable.</li>
<li><strong>Spirits of Demons</strong> - Can't go into bucket, but loop, unless they are consumed in giving you a theme.</li>
<li>-</li>

<td><strong>EPIC CHARITY ANNOUNCEMENT - AUCTION COMPLETE!</strong>
<p>There are TWO winners - the bidding got so high, I doubled up the prize, and gave it each to the top two! The winners are&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>The TFF Alliance</strong>,<br />
and <strong>Tempest</strong>,<br />
for their matched bids of <strong>ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH!</strong> omg. 11DB dollars. for SERIOUS.</p>
<p>Working on their allies as I type this, expect them in the game SUPER soon, with pics as soon as I can get to my art supplies. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH for your donations, we here at Anime Cubed and the RIT Anime Club love you. :)</p>
<p>BvS is teaming up with the <strong>RIT Anime Club</strong> (don't contact them, contact us) to auction off a super crazy prize! All proceeds are going to <strong><a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/" target="_blank">Child's Play</a></strong>, because hey, they are awesome too. On December 18th, at around 8 PM EST (that's 7PM BillyTime), the 200-some person RIT Anime Club will be auctioning a number of cool things off for charity (with yours truly as the auctioneer, oh yeah!), and through the MAGIC of the INTERNET, you can join in the fun, and bid on the following EPIC PRIZE:</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Become an ally in Billy Vs. SNAKEMAN!</strong></span></p>
<p>That's right, your own custom picture, ability, team-ups, and everything! You'll also be able to pick how you are acheived, and even be able to give them out for free to all your friends!</p>
<p>In addition, you'll get <strong>an autographed sketch of all the BvS characters I can fit in one picture, drawn by me!</strong> (most of the character art in-game is mine, so hey, it isn't that bad, right? Plus, if you are like 'make it mostly Stalkergirl because STALKERGIRL IS HOT', then I'll be happy to oblige!) If you want to participate, here's the deal:<br />
Email <span class="wiki-email">moc.liamg|yalPsdlihCSvB#moc.liamg|yalPsdlihCSvB</span> (that's me!) ASAP with your name, email, and a statement saying you are 18 or over (because you need to be 18 or over), or a parent's email saying THEY are 18+. about a week from the auction, we'll contact you to make sure you are legit, and you can pick one of two things - you can either put a 'maximum bid' in, or you can bid the night of the auction LIVE via the INTERNET (on IRC, or even by phone with me, if that's something we can pull off)! There's a TON of Billy Players in the RIT Anime Club, including many of the game's top names, so you won't be alone.<br />
Again, all proceeds go to Child's Play, so don't worry, all is well. If you are interested, email us ASAP!</p>
<p>AND NOW FOR THE FINE PRINT DESU:<br />
<span style="font-size:8pt">Any info you send to me will not be given out or anything stupid like that, so email and supply info with confidence. When you send that first email, do NOT expect a reply. Il'l get back to you around the 11th-12th or so. If you don't hear from me by the 14th, then go ahead and email / BR back. All pictures, ally names, powers, and other such stuffs have to be approved by the 11DBHK. Yes, it can totally be your name, so if all your buddies call you 'Big Face Joe', then 'Big Face Joe' is the name. I'll work with you on making sure it is epic, and not totally game-breaking (however, game-'bending' is cool).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:8pt">Don't bid if you want to name yourself 'Butt Face' or have a nasty picture or anything. If, like, you are actually two or three people, and you want your ally to be 'Jill and Susie' because you are pooling your monies, that's cool too. Also, no horribly broken PvP allies, just to keep me from dealing with crybabies. Auction open to anyone 18 or older who will actually pay - if you aren't, your parent can 'vouch' for you, that's cool. PAyment will be via PayPal, check, or Money Order (we'll give you the address if you win). You don't have to be in the US. Auction starts at 8, but the Billy stuff prolly won't come up until 845-ish, so you may have to hold on a bit. If you are a 'max bid' person, someone there will bid for you in 5$ increments until you win or get fully outbid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:8pt">Bidding of any sort, once you are verified, is a contract - if the person above you bails, you are the new winner. Expect the bidding to be high, but please don't be all 'OMG ONE PILLION DOLARS', and ruin this for everyone - this is a supar-charity-thing, and we want it to be all nice and stuff. Yes, all proceeds - every last penny - is going to Child's Play, RIT Anime Club and I are not keeping a dime. Thanks in advance!<br />

<p><strong>NEW PARTY HOUSE GAME</strong> to tide you over during the recode - the Big Board! (note: I upped the numbers you can pick, and the prize you can win. however, that meant about 7 of you had invalidated entries. you've been reimbursed twofold.)</p>

Should player power reach the point that players will regularly need to cart around over 160 items, I will change it. Let me know if there are problems. Also, the Bucket now sorts alphabetically.</p>

Doing so grants you only half style. This is to cut back on all the grief that comes from innocent Style farmers. Further changes - Getting bingo'd through foolishness (Creepy Traps, losing a Bingo Attack, etc) Bingos you for 24 hours exactly, no bonuses.</p>

<p><strong>Bingo Timer Change:</strong> When you are Bingo'd by an attacking Ninja, you are Bingo'd for 1 hour per level of yours. Note tat the Medic facility helps with this now.</p>
<p><strong>Red Water Change:</strong> Red Water now gives a flat 10 hour discount to your Bingo Timer when it is in effect. This is due to upcoming changes in the length of Bingo Timers.</p>
<p><strong>ITEM MAILING IS LIVE!</strong> You may mail one item a day from your Storehouse. It costs Stamina (unless you are a leader). The recipient won't get it until Dayroll. You can't send it unless you can put it in the Storehouse. You can only send one a day. You need to be a Chunin+ or S2+. You can only get three items a day max. Wolves may eat you (not really, unless I fix up the Wolf Eats Your Face code). But still, yay, item time. This was put in specifically because it was so requested on the Survey.</p>

<p><strong>Sannin Revamp:</strong> Sannin now just needs 2Mil Ranking XP (1 Mil for S1, thanks to everyone who pointed out how impossible it was in a nice way, as for the ones who were 'uncouth' about it, well, enjoy the ban), like how S2 Jonin needs 500K. Whatever. The REAL AWESOME is that if you CAN get Top Three as a 51+ Jonin or Sannin (yes Sannin are in the rankings now), there's a new FREE SHINY MISSION. Get to it. (before you baw, anyone who is currently Sannin got a free pass into the Top Three mission. You'll just see the second, easy half of it)</p>
<p><strong>Congrats to the two newest Kaiju</strong>, AgentBrand and Celeste!</p>
<p><strong>GAME CHANGES DUE TO SURVEYS:</strong> Leveling is slower at higher levels, so you can hang back from Looping longer. Instead of getting 30 Bonus Stamina + 30 More from BvS stuffs, you get 5 per hour, so you can log in later on in the day to play a little more. :) You still need to do it once a day for that Consecutive Days bonus, so you know.<br />
Villagers don't count as idle until 15 days. PMs now only cost 50 Ryo to send. Every 500 wins in the Arena get you 1 free fight per day. More to come.</p>

<p><strong>Exploit Plugged:</strong> We USED to let people leave their village for the day so they could get their full Ryo on, but certain individuals have been doing this to the detriment of other players, so you can't do it anymore. If you leave a Village, you get half Ryo for the day in Missions.</p>
<h2 id="toc300"><span>July 25, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND:</strong> Lay off any un-needed suggestions, or Bug Reports you didn't ABSOLUTELY CHECK OUT FIRST (that means, you know, check to see if you have a Vilage Upgrade giving you a bonus, or if your UTILITY BELT IS GIVING YOU BACK YOUR SEALED KUNAI I GET TWELVE OF THESE BRS A DAY -_-), since if they aren't serious, I won't reply to them. -11DBHK</p>

<p><strong>Batman Puzzle</strong> now no longer requires you to do the scavenger hunt, you can do it from the Puzzles menu. NOTE: Normally, it takes months before we release the items like this after a promotion, but because of all the grief this one caused, we're letting it slide.</p>
<h2 id="toc303"><span>July 21, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Two New Allies,</strong> since they are awesome. You can get both in the Shop menu, if you can figure it out..</p>
<h2 id="toc304"><span>July 20, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Slight Special Mission Change:</strong> 'Rock Out' only unlocks if one of the Sounds is in your party.</p>
<p><strong>Full Moon can now be Full Moon Waxing</strong>: This moon cannot be lost in the arena, giving you two days (regular and Waning) to fight to keep it.</p>
<p><strong>JUICE BAR</strong>: New awesome Village Upgrade available. Yes, it is mad expensive. It's worth it.</p>
<p><strong>THE CRANK - Major Game Change</strong>: Instead of difficulty going up after each season, there is now <strong>The Crank</strong>, which lets you make the game harder or easier. You do this in the Themes menu. Normally, it is once a day for 50 stamina, but this weekend it is free, and can be done as much as you want. <strong>Drops that needed S2 now need Difficulty 1, and S3 = Difficulty 3.</strong></p>
<h2 id="toc305"><span>July 19, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>NEW FREAKING SUPER AWESOME REFERRALS:</strong> When you refer someone, you get <strong><span style="color: #a10000">+5 Stamina EVERY DAY THEY PLAY!</span></strong><br />
The details: say, if you get 5 friends into the game, once a day you can check your main page. if they played most of their stamina the day before, it'll give you a 'Tale' of their deeds. Click on it for 5 stamina! Woo! update: Old Refers are working now, too! Bonuses start tomorrow!</p>
<h2 id="toc306"><span>July 17, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Batman is apparently STILL bugged:</strong> We're working with them over it, but I can't take the link down. At the very least, go through the Anime Cubed part of it, and put a way to get the item once the promotion is over (in about a week).</p>
<p><strong>I'm a bit under the weather,</strong> so I'm taking some days off. Season 3 peeps, enjoy the new Special Mission. -11DBHK</p>
<p><strong>The 'Ingredients' of the Letter of Marque</strong> now Loop.</p>
<h2 id="toc307"><span>July 13, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Video 4</strong> on the Batman Scavenger Hunt seems to not work for some people. We'll have an alternative method of getting the Utility Belt if it keeps up. so stop Bug Reporting it, there's nothing we can do. -_-.</p>
<p><strong>NOTES FROM THE DESK OF THE 11DBHK:</strong> So, I've been looking at Villages recently, and now that Terri 3 (yay Terri) is in the mix, the main reason to be a Leader - the auto Monster Drop - is kinda moot. Now, if you are the only one that has Terri 3, you just kick the tires of a kaiju, and bam, free shiny. That's cool and all, but it makes being a Leader kinda 'meh'. So, starting tomorrow, the following Leader Bonus is active:<br />
&quot;If you are the Leader of a Village at Dayroll, during the next day, while you are still the Leader of that Village, you get <strong>+30 Stamina</strong>, <strong>+10% Ryo in Regular Missions</strong>, your Kaiju Damage is Doubled, and your <strong>Collection Actions and Patrol Actions are Tripled</strong>.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="toc308"><span>July 11, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Batman</strong> stuff can now be done from the main page. No need to do all the puzzles.</p>
<p><strong>The Training Sash</strong> now requires a simple Special Mission to obtain (unlocks at Special Jonin rank).</p>
<h2 id="toc309"><span>July 10, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Four New Village Upgrades</strong>, courtesy of the research of EvilTaxi. Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>Batman hunt live!</strong> Apparently, everything is fixed. Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>Batman hunt update:</strong> One of the other sites that is part of the Scavenger hunt seems to be, well, messed up. So, if you go to a site that doesn't have the clip, just <strong>hold on</strong> for a day or two until it is fixed. Do NOT bug report it. Don't worry - the hunt will be around for a while, we just have to wait until they fix themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Batman Prizes!</strong> Go through the Scavenger Hunt, and check the 'Puzzles', to get a nifty prize! No telling others the answer, though - help us out!</p>

<h2 id="toc311"><span>July 6, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Email Confirmation:</strong> Email Confirmation has been added to BvS. <strong>We suggest doing it ASAP</strong>. You won't need to do it right away, but eventually, you'll need to do it to go to the Village menu. Confirming gets you a helpful item and 50 Stamina!</p>
<p><strong>Filler Episodes:</strong> Season 3+ players now have a long Special Mission that allows them to make it any month with a special mission or content, like Ninja Love Day, Billypendence, and so on. Enjoy! (note: Shortbunny is now April, and Sham Rocks drop only during March - but in all ingredients, not just rare days, and Fireworks are only sold during July).</p>
<p><strong>Monochrome Battle Change:</strong> If you cannot gain moon, your opponent cannot lose moon. (i.e. losing to a non-Waxing &quot;Full Moon&quot; player does not cost you a moon, nor can you earn one)</p>
<p><strong>'Bones Get'</strong> special mission is now slightly easier.</p>
<p><strong>Juicy Apples</strong> are now consumable. Mmm, tasty!</p>
<h2 id="toc312"><span>July 5, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Tournament Fighters</strong> no longer trigger monochrome or light hour battles.</p>
<p><strong>Dog Treats Added to C-Rank Mission</strong> for balancing purposes. Thanks, Rajgore, for the idea.</p>
<p><strong>HAPPY BILLYPENDENCE DAY!</strong> Chunin and above can buy Fireworks from the store, and set those puppies off on your main screen like potions. Secrets abound within them! (Fireworks will be around at least through this and next weekend)</p>
<p>Total Number of Fireworks Launched in BvS: <strong>117462</strong></p>

PLEASE do not give out the completion code to your friends - people going through these things is what pays for this site.</p>
<p><strong>Land of Baw</strong> is now Season 2+, requires you not yet complete Tsukuyomi Ascendant, and needs Miss Kitty 2 and the Dark Band, so people know what they are getting into.</p>
<h2 id="toc314"><span>July 2, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Light Hour Arena Points:</strong> Should be just like normal points, no bonuses. Before you spread misinformation, please double-check it first.</p>

<p><strong>Hanging Out Free Chakra Will be changing:</strong> It might be changing to half off, maybe 75% off, we aren't sure yet. but, too many ideas had to be scrapped because &quot;oh, with the Hangout Bonus it's broken&quot;. Stay tuned, we'll give notice before the change.</p>

<p><strong>Right Theme UnFailing:</strong> The Right 2 Theme kinda stunk. Now it is awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Wasteland Entry Changed:</strong> It's now 15 Diff, not 16. This is actually a Big Deal.</p>
<p><strong>Potion Balancing:</strong> Smokestacks now cost much less appetite, but give two less Smokebombs.</p>
<p><strong>Potion Revamp!</strong> Potions now use 'Appetite' instead of just being one a day. you have 100% Appetite + 20% per Ninja Rank (Sp. Jonin and Jonin count as the same rank).</p>

<p><strong>New Party House Game</strong> for Season 3+ Players!</p>
<h2 id="toc330"><span>June 9, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>New Arena Stuffs</strong>: Special Jonin get a non-looping item called 'Training Sash'. This item lets you use your bloodline's ability in the Arena. Note that this does not EARN you the ability, so you won't keep it when you loop. Characters who would have gotten this item were just given it.</p>
<p><strong>Jutsu XP vs. Daily Ranking:</strong> We have ironed out the XP/AP bonus vs. Daily XP inaccuracies. If a bonus gives you a general XP/AP bonus, then it counts for Ranking. If not (a Gen bonus, a JXP bonus, etc), it doesn't.</p>
<p><strong>Hanging Out Base Change:</strong> You now need 3000, not 1000, FP to show up in the rankings or Hang Out.</p>
<h2 id="toc331"><span>June 7, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>More Potion Stuff:</strong> The Reversing Hourglass now shows on your Main Screen if it is enabled (by the Dark Hour area).</p>
<h2 id="toc332"><span>June 6, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Further Potion Changes:</strong> You now don't have to 'select a recipe' - any recipe you have will be used automatically if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Potion Mixing:</strong> A failed mixture only loses you the second ingredient.</p>
<h2 id="toc333"><span>June 5, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Additional attributes to the B-Rank Missions:</strong> We've seen players get really 'bent out of shape' when they hit, say, Tai Special Jonin, and then go huge on Tai simply because it is all they can do. To alleviate that, more B-ranks will be double-stat now.</p>
<p><strong>New LisaLisa 2 Jutsu</strong> for all the WhiteEyes out there.</p>
<p><strong>New Inactive Character Policy:</strong> Characters that are 60 days inactive will be deleted, regardless of Bingo Book and Village status.</p>
<h2 id="toc334"><span>June 3, 2008</span></h2>

<p><strong>Password Issues?</strong> forward-slashes are now no longer allowed in passwords. If you used one (/) in your password, your new password is now the same as your old one, but with the /-slash removed. So, for example, if your password was &quot;monkey/butler&quot;, it is now &quot;monkeybutler&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="toc336"><span>May 29, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Changes Today:</strong> 'Tickets' for monster drops have been recalibrated. For those of you interested in the math, remember this, because it isn't going into the How To Play:<br />
- Each successful attack entered counts as a number of tickets equal to the number of attacks you've made so far on this monster. EXAMPLE: the first attack you do is worth 1 ticket. The second, 2. The third, 3. This spans over days, so if you have, say, 6 swings total, you have 1+2+3+4+5+6=21 chances to win the item. You cannot get more than 10 tickets normally per swing (see exceptions below). If you did 12 hits, they'd be 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+10+10.<br />
- If you have the item already, your tickets count half as much.<br />
- If you are using Destiny Fulfilled, your tickets count twice as much.</p>

<p><strong>Counterfeit Permits</strong> are now sold by, duh, the Pass Permits upgrade.</p>

<h2 id="toc339"><span>May 26, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>New Saboteur Item:</strong> Counterfeit Permit, Chunin or Higher.</p>
<p><strong>Name / Item Changes:</strong> Touchy is now Itachy (The Itachy and Skratchy show, ha ha, thanks immolas for the idea), but maybe still just Touchy (Touchy and Skratchy? hm..) and some of the village monsters' stuff will be changing. Further name changes may be possible, when Wasteland launches.</p>
<h2 id="toc340"><span>May 25, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>NEW VILLAGE UPGRADES INCOMING:</strong> Self-Sufficiency, Pass Permits, and a new ability for Interrogators. Stay Tuned. (edit: SelfSuf is in, rest to follow very shortly)</p>
<p><strong>Potion Bases now a Party House Common</strong>: and not an Arena reward. Thanks to RurGo for the idea.</p>
<h2 id="toc341"><span>May 24, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Arena Testing Tomorrow:</strong> 30 minutes before we start some hard core arena testing, we'll put up a notice on the main arena screen (where you buy fights). When that is up, <strong>stay out of the Arena -</strong> we've got some work to do.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing changes:</strong> To prepare for the new area of BvS, a more robust pricing system will be put into place. This means that things will no longer sell for exactly 50% of their full worth, but a range. Changes to each item's sell-rate in progress.</p>
<h2 id="toc342"><span>May 23, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>More Things Loop:</strong> Everyone pretty much just dumps their stuff in the Storehouse before looping, and picks it why. Why bother, we say. Lots more stuff now Loops, and it will tell you what *doesn't* loop. Also, you'll stop being able to leave messages, but you'll show on the front page now!</p>
<h2 id="toc343"><span>May 22, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>How to Submit an Arena Bug Report:</strong> Apparently, people cannot follow instructions. I'll never be able to fix this if the only reports I get are &quot;LOL I DUN SKIPPED A TERN&quot;. What to do: I need to know who you were playing, the score, how many wins you had so far, the line of text it outputs that is says to 'copy into the bug reporter', and your java error console if any. C'mon, folks. -11DBHK</p>
<p><strong>Village Storehouse Self-Sorts:</strong> Now the Storehouse will sort itself whenever someone puts an item into it.</p>
<p><strong>Carapace Armor bonus changed:</strong> This is an ancient bug, the Armor was duplicating another item's bonus, and has been fixed.</p>

<p><strong>Today is Track Down Arena Bug Day:</strong> We have a mod on-call for any bug report pertaining to the Arena. If you get a 'Match does not Exist' bug, or a 'stuck timer' bug, BUG REPORT IT PROPERLY. In a couple minutes, re-check your mainpage announcements, for a link to chat with the BvS mods. We'll give big prizes out to the people who finally help us track it down. Timeouts will be wiped tonight, and tomorrow there will be extra fights.</p>
<p><strong>S2 NWW Items</strong> now loop.</p>
<p><strong>Season 1 Genin Bingo Partial Immunity:</strong> S1 Genin have 4 hour bingo timers, not 36, and also no longer give Style Point bonuses.</p>
<h2 id="toc347"><span>May 18, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Minor Arena Bug Fixed:</strong> Everyone gets 3 free fights instead of 1 tomorrow. If you get a 'Match does not exist' error, *please* follow instructions and send reports, even though we don't reply. we read each and every one, but are focused on fixing things, not just, well, replying to bugreports.</p>
<p><strong>S2 Jonin:</strong> Now only require 2 Bloodlines, not 3. However, you need 500K Daily XP to pass. Sannin, however, now requires 3 Bloodlines.</p>
<p><strong>'Find Bonus' Double Clarifications:</strong> White Eye, and only White Eye (not Epic Dog, Ramen, etc) will help in finding events. The Jutsu is being updated to reflect this.</p>
<h2 id="toc348"><span>May 17, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>'Find Bonus' Clarifications:</strong> Please note that Jutsu and Abilities that double your bonus to find Items / Ninja do *not* help you trigger Bonus Stamina / Ryo / XP events.</p>
<p><strong>Three New D-Rank Missions:</strong> There's nothing in them yet, but there will be eventually..</p>
<p><strong>Mild change to Shikai and Bankai:</strong> -2 Levels, not 1. -1 Str, not -2.</p>
<h2 id="toc349"><span>May 16, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Arena Exploit Found, Stopped:</strong> To stop a certain Arena exploit, you now cannot gain or lose 'Moon' from fighting someone you've already fought that day. Also, Timeout rules have been put in place, check the How to Play for details. Tonight, all Timeouts will be wiped, leaving a fresh start.</p>

<p><strong>Message costs lowered:</strong> It now only costs 200 Ryo to mail someone, not 500. If you catch a spammer, let us know, so we can ban them. :)</p>
<p><strong>Season 2+ Jonin Level Requirements lowered:</strong> You now need 3 extra levels per Season, not 6.</p>
<p><strong>Dark Hour Waning Fix:</strong> Monochrome fighters will now need three wins *during a Dark Hour* to keep their Moon from waning. However, a single upgrade or downgrade in your Moon will do just fine.</p>
<h2 id="toc352"><span>May 9, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Updates to Genin Level:</strong> Training Missions removed for now. Allies have a higher drop rate. A number of Missions require less successes / have a slightly lower difficulty. Certain special Missions are easier. Spot is now a Chunin Rank Special Mission, but is twice as cool. Genin now cannot do Ingredient Collection. Shuriken / Tag prices cheaper. More to come.</p>

<p><strong>Retaking Leadership of a Village</strong>: We've had enough instances of Village Takeover crap that we've instituted a new policy - Village Leaders that give up their ability to Lead to someone else have a limited timeframe where they can forcefully take it back. Read the How to Play for details.</p>
<p><strong>New Kage Council Rules</strong>: We're getting sick of all the begging for members, so now you'll get banned if you beg for them.</p>
<h2 id="toc354"><span>May 7, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Advanced Resource Kaiju Summoning</strong> Now takes 3, not 8. Thanks to Millennium for the idea.</p>

<p><strong>New 'Welcome to Billy' Missions!</strong> New players now get one easy Special Mission per day for the first three days, and end up with a nice little item for doing them. They are open to everyone, so have fun! (NOTE: You will need to Collect for this mission. Patrolling works as well. Sannin will have to wait until they Loop.)</p>
<p><strong>Bugfix</strong>: The 'dark hour but no dark hour bonus' Arena thing has been fixed.</p>
<p><strong>More New Stuffs</strong>:Leaders can now send one Announcement a day - a message that also shows on the announcements of everyone in their village.</p>

<p><strong>New Stuffs</strong>: New Bingo Item for those too-powerful folk out there, and Arena players get one free fight per day. New prizes forthcoming, starting with the Roll of Tickets. Sigs should show Arena titles at 100, 250, 500, and 1000 by the end of the day for people with Arena Favorite (are now live). Thanks to Aeryes, Celeste, Corian, Drazhar, Hav0c, Lafiel, Universum, and Vysaga.</p>
<p><strong>Dayroll Issues Part 2 - READ BEFORE BUG REPORTING:</strong> Think of today as if there wasn't a dayroll, and you got 150% stamina and 6 NWW attacks.<br />
THINGS YOU DO NOT NEED TO BUGREPORT:<br />
Everyone is being given double NWW attacks today and 150% stamina, regardless of bloodline.<br />
Yes, your daily XP / daily NWW didn't reset.<br />
Yes, you should use your bonus stamina codes again.<br />
Yes, your village size didn't update.<br />
Yes, the top player XP / friends page is off.<br />
Yes, we know that the people you are hanging out with didn't actually register.<br />
You didn't lose their FP, so it isn't too much of an issue.<br />
Yes, you didn't get your chakra back.<br />
Yes you can ingredient hunt again. Yes we know that for a very small group of people this is a little less stamina than normal.<br />
Yes, we know your Moon did not wane, your sparring partners, your free team switch, and other such things that reset at dayroll didn't.<br />
Yes, we know you didn't get your Science bonuses, even though it said you did - tomorrow's dayroll, <strong>all Science! machines with a probability of 2% or more will activate if unleashed.</strong><br />
No, we aren't just going to roll day, because we don't want to deal with all the loop timers and monster days and this and that and everything else we get reports for.<br />
Yes, we know you can't patrol or collect - it saved the thing you did yesterday, so your village has all the patrol and collect bonuses you gave it yesterday.</p>
<p>Just <strong>*please</strong>* do not bugreport this stuff, play like normal, and wait for tomorrow. Just deal with it for the day, tomorrow will be fine. Just think of today as actually 'yesterday lasting 48 hours'. If you still bug report one of these specific things, you will be ignored. -_-</p>
<p><strong>Dayroll issues:</strong> Due to some weird hiccup in the freaking dayroller, only 1% of people got their stamina back. STOP BUGREPORTING IT. it'll fix in a second.</p>

<p><strong>Dark Hour Leniency:</strong> If a Monochrome Reaper wins at least three battles in the Arena during a Dark Hour (even against non-Monochrome players), their Moon will not wane that day. That way, players won't get stuok fighting scrubs (no offense) and losing their attunement.</p>
<h2 id="toc358"><span>April 27, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Headband upgrade</strong>: Working on some cool stuffs, brought up by a tip from WingedCat. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>New Friend Franking System</strong>: The new friend ranking system shows the top 10, and allows one person to hang out with an Ally per day - two if the top friend points are over 5000, and then +1 for every 25000 points the top friend has (so an ally with 75000 points would have the top five players hanging out. one for free, +2 at 5K, 3 at 25, 4 at 50, and 5 at 75.). To flush out some of the allies, all of them that have at least 10 players who have obtained them and are over 5000 top points will all be hanging out with their whole top 10 today.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome, Toracon players</strong>! Hope you like the game! -11DBHK</p>
<p><strong>Lots of new players, no updates for a couple days</strong>: I don't want to break anything on the new players.</p>
<p><strong>Potion Reverse Nerf</strong>: Silver Potions are now twice as powerful. -11DBHK</p>
<p><strong>Dark Hour Bonuses</strong>:You get 50% more Arena Points if you play during a Dark Hour and win.</p>
<p><strong>Potion Suggestions</strong>:We're adding a new potion area into the game, and would like your ideas on potions. Send them via the suggestion box.</p>
<p><strong>Silver Potions more powerful</strong>:double the friend points as before, effective immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Three Thousand Players</strong>! Three thousand active players per day now. Thanks, everyone!</p>

<p><strong>New Upgrade:</strong> 'Overseers' allow Special Jonin to collect Resources. Small size, big benefits!</p>
<p><strong>New Arena Points Calculation:</strong> The losing player in the arena gets 10 Points if they stay the whole match and don't disconnect. Thanks to <strong>Questara</strong> for the awesome idea.</p>
<p><strong>Starter Pics changed:</strong> New ninja look like Billy and Stalkergirl. Why no Pinky? I had to pick one guy and one girl, and Stalkergirl has big guns. Not that I like big guns or anything. &gt;_&gt; -11DBHK</p>
<p><strong>Yes, Your old Hangouts are still there:</strong> Don't bug report them. We held a lot of the 'bad' parts of the dayroll back (losing hangouts, some FP, monster timers, etc) as a payback for yesterday's crap. Some of you may go to 22 days on your dayroll - don't bug report it , we're working on it.</p>
<h2 id="toc361"><span>April 22, 2008</span></h2>
<p><strong>Random Genin Village Jumping:</strong> We're making it live right now - it'll say 'NinjaName wandered into your village'. Make your announcement awesome, and thanks for making a village! On top of that, if someone comes through YOUR link to make their character, and your village has the random genin thing on, <strong>they'll join YOUR village</strong> if they go random!</p>
<p><strong>Regarding Bug Reports:</strong> It says RIGHT THERE in the checkboxes below the bug reporter that you have A: Read the front page, and B: are not bug reporting because some stupid website told you that you can get Billy Level 6 just by having 1 Kunai in your inventory, or stupid crap like that. We are going to start penalizing people for being idiots. You've been warned.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus due to bug:</strong> Today and tomorrow (as in, tonight's dayroll and tomorrow night's as well), Science and resource output will be doubled - science will have twice the chance, and you'll get 2X the ryo and resources. This is to give morning-only villages a chance to get in on the action as well.</p>
<p><strong>Cobra Kai:</strong> The mission that gets you this Blood Ability now requires a Leveled-Up Strawberry. Check the high-level Monochrome Tai missions.</p>
<p><strong>Sham Rock Mission Note:</strong> You need to be Sp. Jonin or higher to start it now.</p>
<p><strong>FALLOUT OF BUG (today only):</strong><br />
- It'll be a little slow between now and noon, as everyone logs in. please think about maybe waiting an hour to play.<br />
- Villages won't get their resource collection today.<br />
- Science won't have gone off. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">THE FIX: During the next dayroll, all ryo / resources given will be TRIPLED. all science chances will be TRIPLED.)</span> (see above)<br />
- many players will seem 'inactive'. just go do your regular missions for the day first, it'll 'wake you up'.<br />
- some of you may be 'hanging out' with the same person twice or three times. it was either that, or lose your hangouts completely. don't bug report it, it will fix itself.</p>
<p><strong>DAYROLL BUG FOUND/FIXED:</strong> Lottery exploiter found and banned. Dayroll complete. If you missed a timer on a mission (Cutter Emosuke, Bankai), if your monster's timer / sabotage is a problem (and ONLY if it is a problem), let us know AFTER NOON EDT (so we can clear out the bug reports), and we'll fix you. Same goes with other such stuff. You may have doubled-up stamina messages, etc - that is not a bug. Just chill.</p>
<h3 id="toc362"><span>April 21, 2008</span></h3>
<p><strong>New Genin in Villages</strong>: In the next few days, we'll be rolling out an option that lets Genin just 'jump' into any village that chooses to specifically allow new random players. That way, Genin can quickly get started in the game, and you new villages can get some people. Leaders have it next to their 'application' area. It isn't active yet, but you can turn it on (if you are accepting villagers) so it will be ready to go when it launches.</p>
<p><strong>THREE THOUSAND PLAYERS</strong>: Thanks, everyone, for getting us to three thousand players! As a reward, I've added a Lottery in the Party House, to give away shiny shinies, and even monster drops! Keep getting people to join, and I'll keep making new things! If got a lot of Art to go through, and once I do that, I'll set up the next major upgrade - Pirates! -11DBHK (Note: Wow, lots of people are playing the lottery. We'll look into adding more prizes to it!</p>
<h3 id="toc363"><span>April 19, 2008</span></h3>
<p><strong>'Dark Hours'</strong>: These are certain times of day when Monochrome Reapers can get certain special things done. For those of you that don't know what is up, these hours are good times to get some fights in the Arena under your belt. You can find them on your main page, under the server time. Stay tuned for more!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><strong>Slight Change to Ingredient Hunting</strong>: Due to some exploiters, only one player per IP per day can collect ingredients.</span></p>
<p>You know what is more fun than that? Banning the crap out of idiots, and letting everyone else have a fun game. New rule: The later IPs will just get -1 ingredients if that IP collected that day. Just don't go building up a big load of ingredients, moving to another village, and dumping it, so that your alt can pick it up. ESPECIALLY if you are a filthy storehouse robber. The system's written to catch that now. NOTE TO THE, oh, SEVEN PEOPLE I HAVE THE LOGS ON THAT DID THIS, INCLUDING THE LEADER OF THAT ONE VILLAGE: Enjoy this page, because it's the only one from Billy that your IP will ever see again. Go watch some filler. <em>-11DBHK</em></p>
<p><strong>Mad Scientists HP lowered</strong>: Contat us if yo uare a Leader of a village fighting them, and they started at 25K. If it checks out, we'll knock it down a bit.</p>
<p><strong>New Kaiju</strong>: Super Robots! (Enticement Only)</p>
<p><strong>For the eleventy billionth time</strong>: IF you got your info on how to unlock something form some website, and it doesn't work, <strong>DOUBLE CHECK WITH OTHERS BEFORE BUG REPORTING</strong>. The number of &quot;Waah Bankai won't unlock&quot; and &quot;Waah Soul Candy won't unlock&quot; because they are reading crap boards with wrong info is MADDENING.</p>
<p><strong>Looping</strong>: You can now loop if you are within striking range of the cap, even before the cap hits. Helpful for those not looking to hang back, but instead forge ahead to a new season.</p>
<p><strong>Friend Point Change</strong>: To stop the people who first get into new content abusing the 'only one to hang out' friend bonus, you must have at least 1000 friend points with someone to hang out with them.</p>
<p><span style="color:red">MONOCHROME (REAPER THREE) IS LIVE!</span> Season 2+ and the Captain's Jacket to unlock! <em>WARNING: Crazy hard. Proceed with caution! Special props to <strong>Lafiel</strong> for being the first into the new Missions! -11DBHK</em></p>
<p><strong>In-Mission Stats</strong>: New stat box on the side. It counts everything, from potions to Village Bonuses, so don't bug report when you forget you have a Jonin Academy.</p>
<p><strong>Loop Limits Changed</strong>: This is sudden, but necessary to allow players to get to the higher level stuffs. Loop Limit is now 20-in-a-stat + 3 per completed season (first loop: 20 Gen-or-Nin-or-Tai starts it. second loop: 23 G/N/T starts it. etc, up to season 4). Those still in the Loop will have their loop timers reset, but will not get back any levels they lost for hitting 14 days.</p>
<p><strong>New Reaper Stuffs tomorrow</strong>! Season 2 or Higher + Captain's Jacket to Unlock!</p>
<div class="image-container aligncenter"><img src="http://bvs.wdfiles.com/local--files/old-news-archive/ReaperStuffs.jpg" alt="ReaperStuffs.jpg" class="image" /></div>
<p><strong>Bingoing back up</strong>: Unexpected downtime, it is all better. People can pick up where they left off.</p>
<p><strong>New Enticement-Only Monster</strong>: 'Mad Scientists'.</p>
<p><strong>Bingo Academy Item</strong>: Perimeter Barrier now available to those with Bingo Academies. Defensive players may keep Teams from affecting a Bingo Attempt. Each can do this twice before breaking.</p>
<p><strong>Bingo Time Limit</strong>: You now have five minutes from hitting the 'attack' button on a Bingo Attempt to finish the mission, or you automatically lose. Also, if someone tries to bingo you and fails, it lets you know right away.</p>
<p><strong>Late Night Snack Changed</strong>: This Monster Drop is now no longer useless. :)</p>
<p><strong>Bingo Academy Item</strong>: Bingo Armor now available to those with Bingo Academies. They lower the damage done by Abilities and Jutsu in a Bingo to 40 if it does more than 40. Each Bingo Armor can do this twice before breaking.</p>
<p><strong>Hairpin Piece Nerf Warning</strong>: Starting Tuesday afternoon, the Hairpin mission will only be able to be performed once a day.</p>
