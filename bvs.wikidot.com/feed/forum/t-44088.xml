						 <p>The max difficulty with all the defence upgrades seems to be around 37. Anything higher than that is due to peacetime. It's impossible for any ninja to achieve 76 successes. In fact, any number of successes above 15 should be considered impossible since that amount of peacetime will also give a very high difficulty.<br /> Invasion Defence buffs difficulty by 20. Only Legacy nin can use the summon that increases range in attacks.</p>

						 <p>It takes 50 Stamina to attack.</p> <p>Generally, most times one attacks, you'll see difficulty and successes in the low teens, but once enhancements and such go into place, you can run into low 20s.</p> <p>Not that much of a problem at the higher levels. There are Summons and Items that boost your range and also Ashen War Paint that is +10 to range. With the right equipment, often from Monsters, hitting difficulties in the mid 30s is not unheard of.</p>

						 <p>Joint attacks are not possible. The village you looked into attacking very likely had an extremely high peacetime bonus, and I don't know of anyone who could have succeeded in attacking them with those numbers. Smaller villages are harder to spy on, larger are harder to attack.</p>

						 <p>I'm not an expert on this (though, I should work on a guide for it at some point, I suppose). I'm guessing you tried to attack a Village that was smaller than yours, had some upgrades like Invasion Defense pointed at your village. They may also have a rather nice peace time bonus going.</p> <p>Last time I attacked a Village, the difficulty was only like 7 or 8, and the successes were roughly in that same area. That was as a solo attacker running a raid, I don't believe joint efforts are possible.</p>
