						 <p>Alright, so I have a week left before I start getting Stamina cuts due to my loop cap, and most of the preparations for my run are complete. The only big problem is that I only have 3 bloodlines, and need one more.</p> <p>As it stands, I cannot obtain the Trade due to my Loop Lock, and am already pissed off about losing the Note Pages I had saved up in orer to do so. So that's out.</p> <p>I have only just started Burgerninja- Have one edible item, don't have Cici yet…But Greass seems like the easier one to get, especially when…</p> <p>On the other hand, I could go for Eye of the Storm- However, I only unlocked the Inner Wastelands today.</p> <p>So which is more likely to happen?</p>
