		<description>Posts in the discussion thread &quot;The Yogure Village Recruiting&quot; - The Yogure (The Village Hidden in Twilight) needs people so that we can get better upgrades. We are aiming for Entincement Altar (among other things) so that all of our members have an easier time getting Kaiju Drops...</description>

						 <p>I'd have to ask the Kage (SaberZ) about that. Chances are he'll just hand the village over to someone else and join Manifest to help you guys out, but head back to The Yogure after you guys go boom (more than likely).</p> <p>I mean, I'll go to your village and help out, no problem. But I can't speak for the rest of the village, you know?</p>

						 <p>Hey Aeonis</p> <p>Maybe the 15 of you would like to come to Manifest Village? :)</p> <p>We have every upgrade but lost a bunch of people during x-mas time. If you join us u have all the upgrades and a lot of Kaijuupgrades already built.<br /> Together we would be a real Epic Village in TopTen.<br /> What do you think?</p> <p>You guys would be very welcome :)</p>

						 <p>We are still looking for active players to join — we still have only around 19 people.</p> <p>We are willing to help newer players gather any permanent items they might need for the Reaper (and other) missions, to listen to the suggestions of players that are more experienced, and we are willing to do anything in order to rise in rank; so please, give The Yogure a chance!</p>

						 <p>Well, it's been a couple of days, and we've gotten a few new people — but we've lost even more, keeping our number hovering around 19-20.</p> <p>Again, we're willing to take anyone and everyone, so please, don't hesitate to apply!</p>

						 <p>Hi. I'm Aeonis, and I speak on behalf of the current Kage of The Yogure Village, SaberZ.</p> <p>The Yogure Village has 59 upgrades so far, including BurgerNinja, Natural Research Facility, Potion Palace, and many Kaiju Upgrades as well. But, many of these marvelous facilities are going to waste, due to a lack of active, contributing members.</p> <p>We need active members so that we can restore our disabled upgrades to full working order, and earn new upgrades to make us rise even higher! So far, we're at the dreadfully low number of 19!</p> <p>Any member, new or experienced, strong or weak, is of great value to us, so please, consider joining The Yogure, and helping it to become one of the great villages of BvS!</p>
