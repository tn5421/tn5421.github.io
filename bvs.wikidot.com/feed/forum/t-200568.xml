						 <blockquote> <p>McMasters(game owner) doesn't support these ads, and temporarily removed an advertiser suspected of them.</p> </blockquote> <p>I figured as much when I saw the News post commenting on one of the ad providers… what was it… "being a fail." In fact this was a great debate in my head as to what their stance or response would be on it- I mean obviously the guy visits his own game occasionally and walking into this aberration would surely raise some fur.</p> <blockquote> <p>The prevailing theory is that you're getting malware from site A, but it's waiting until you go to site B (B for BvS) or rather when it sees a certain ad which happens to be on site B before it activates.</p> </blockquote> <p>I wouldn't put it past this. As destructive as it is, it's very well done. It's like watching a tornado on TV tear through some buildings. So long as I don't contract it again, I think it'll be alright to keep going here. The frequent updates, light tone, and ability to play the game without direct BillyClub membership (A fatal flaw of many games that could otherwise prosper like this one) lead me to believe that McMasters wouldn't sell out.</p> <blockquote> <p>Admittedly, I run Adblock Plus, but when I view the site in Chrome (which does not have anti ad software) I still fail to get infected with anything.</p> </blockquote> <p>I gave Chrome a shot, and after half an hour of it's connection service and my Services being fail I made the switch partially. It's not bad. I still main Fox and Adblock Plus now, as well as NoScript and Spybot's TeaTimer.<br /> Granted, I just got Adblock and NoScript was deactivated when I got infected, but it shows that this process interceptor got past TeaTimer which after a direct update from that day is a very neat trick.</p>

						 <p>I've been playing Billy for 2 years now with chars both BC and non-BC, but I've never encountered said virus. I'm nowhere near an expert as far as computer-related subjects are discussed, though, so I'll rather shut it after that^^</p>

						 <p>I use firefox with only windows firewall as a safeguard(yea, not really safe, I know) and I've never gotten a virus or malware from Billy. However, you're not the first to suspect malicious ads. McMasters(game owner) doesn't support these ads, and temporarily removed an advertiser suspected of them. He also only uses reputable advertisers(if there is such as thing), and has no control of what ads appear. The only thing he can do is remove them when things like this come up.</p>

						 <p>*Stooped</p> <p>Oh, I know. In fact, that's why I posted here. I just wanted the experiences of people who have been on BvS long enough to know the wiki has a forum, and who wouldn't be influenced by the makers. Do you have the BillyClub extension that removes the ads? I don't think it's BvS persay, but rather one of the ad providers being shady and not telling them they're infecting people.</p> <p>Google Chrome and AdBlock plus are strong, so I'm not surprised. I heard from elsewhere that a Windows Update was supposed to fix this rootkit, but then I hear from other places that they GOT it from a Windows Update.</p>

						 <p>I have never gotten any malware from this or the BvS site. Admittedly, I run Adblock Plus, but when I view the site in Chrome (which does not have anti ad software) I still fail to get infected with anything.</p> <p>Also, you are aware that this is not the BvS site, is not monitored by McMasters (except perhaps as just another user), is no more affiliated with BvS than any other fansite, and has just this side of zero chance of directly affecting the actual BvS site or it's ads, yes?</p>

						 <p>A lot of the times when I visit the BvS site and the BvS site alone, my computer mysteriously contracts a new case of Antivirus System PRO which is in fact one of the most powerful Malware programs I've ever seen in my life.</p> <p>The program disables the use of every other application, including the Task Manager and any other programs, until you give into the spyware completely. The only cure is to restart the computer, boot up Task Manager as soon as your desktop appears BEFORE the Malware kicks in, terminate the process "whatever"guard.exe, and follow removal steps from there.</p> <p>I will not be returning to this game if it's stopped to supporting such malicious adware. Now, be honest. Has anyone else contracted this abomination from the BvS site? This one's known to be a Trojan so it might still be hiding on my system somewhere but I know for a <strong>fact</strong> I first saw this thing when playing BvS.</p>
