						 <p>I think our listing is up to date with that forum post. All we were missing was some info on LisaLisa and Bruce Jr. Lvl. 2 from what I could see. We do still need to fill in a few more pages for the allies themselves, and get them listed on the mission page.</p> <p>We're actually ahead of that listing by a little bit, since we've got <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/allies:smokey-the-bear-lvl-2">Smokey the Bear Lvl. 2</a> and they don't.</p>

						 <p>The ally list is a bit out of date, as McMaster has added a few new allies, and some more lvl 2's. Here is a <a href="http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=13164">forum post</a> with some of the newer ones. I've also posted it in the comment on the allies page. I'll add a few right now, but I need to focus on other stuff, so if someone can go though and make sure the list is up to date.</p>
