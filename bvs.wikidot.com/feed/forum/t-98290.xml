						 <p>you don't need 1m xp to finish 2&nbsp;b a master. you just need to be in the top 3, of your respective rank. as in, all those jonins in the top 3 of the top 10 jonin portion of S1 all qualify to finish 2&nbsp;b a master.<br /> today, for example, Atyan, Flammed, Daidaro, (the top 3 sannin of S1) and Docratus, Garrow, Lextopal (the top 3 Jonin of S1) all qualify for "in the top 3"</p>

						 <p>But can a S1 player pull out 1M RXP in 2 consecutive days? I'm not saying that it is impossible but I would not bother to get top 3 this day and do 2&nbsp;B A Master the next day and make 1M RXP to become Sannin.</p>

						 <p>deelle: If you earn the ranking XP again, though, you would be able to. THAT is why I say that it could be done in either order.</p> <p>OP: I don't watch the S1 rankings much, but judging by today's rankings? As I see it, you could choose to do them in either order. However, I would recommend doing "The Big Three" first, to get Sannin. Even if you don't have the range to be doing the AA rank missions, you'll have more stamina, more appetite, and I think more chakra than you'd have as a Jonin. I also think that for S1 only, there's often less competition for the rankings as Sannin, which would make it easier. You might even get in the top 3 ranking for Sannin as a result of going this course, which would allow you to do "2&nbsp;B A MASTER" the next day.</p> <p>That's why doing "The Big Three" first is what most people do, though you should check and make sure that you have met or will be able to meet all of the other requirements for the mission as well.</p>

						 <p>Actually, you can't complete Big Three if you can already complete 2&nbsp;B A Master. Why? Because you definitely don't have the Rankings XP anymore.</p>

						 <p>While the two missions are entirely seperate and can be done in any order, typically the mission to become Sannin ( The Big Three ) would be done first.</p> <p>The main reasons for that are that it requires Ranking XP only and not a spot in the Top 3 that day, and that being Sannin unlocks AA rank missions ( which grant more ranking XP, which will allow you to get a higher spot on the rankings ).</p>
