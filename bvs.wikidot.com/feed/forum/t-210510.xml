						 <p>My first time looking for it, I found it after 7 attempts. Second time took me 23 tries. Third, 15. Right now I'm looking again, and I'm up past 100 tries and haven't found it outside of two pings. Also, make sure to write down the correct field. The instant you get a single 'ping', you're on it. Even after you loop it stays the same, so keep that piece of paper handy when you're ready.</p> <p>Consider the '20+ pings' more of a minor warning, then a guideline. Especially as the entire sub-quest is totally RNG guided. Even when you're on the correct field, it's still a 30% chance per ping, and you have to roll them all correctly, in order. If you fail the (all are hidden) first roll, it auto-fails the other two, so you actually only have about a 1:100 chance of succeeding each try.</p>
