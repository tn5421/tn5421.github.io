						 <p>The costs are relatively minimal. I think I've spent about $40 on stuff like domain names and promotional stuff, and I'd like to recoup a little bit of that. The ads bring in less than $1 a day (usually significantly less). If the cash flow ever got positive, I was going to use the excess money for BvS promotion, but having the additional ads actually seems to be worse than having less with the old ads.</p> <p>Probably in the next day or two I'll change the ad layout again, since the current one isn't working.</p>

						 <p>You may notice some new ads displaying on the site. They're mostly an experiment to try and defray some of the costs associated with running the site. If they are too obnoxious or get in the way of the operation of the site, I'll get rid of them and try and figure out some other way to deal with the expenses.</p> <p>However, feel free to provide feedback in this thread about them, even if it is just to say you hate them.</p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Actually, if you're using Firefox, I'd recommend using Adblock Plus to strip the ads out of the site if they bother you a lot. It's available at <a href="http://adblockplus.org/">http://adblockplus.org/</a> and will block any and all of the ads from the site if you configure it right. It's probably the best of both worlds. The site gets some ad revenue, and if you're not going to click on the ads anyway, you don't have to see them. But I'd only recommend this if the ads are really bothering you.</p>
