						 <p>The <em>first</em> thing you should do is join a village. Let's assume you've done that.</p> <p>Your first impossible missions are to get a Swallowtail Butterfly, a Heck Butterfly, and a Soul Glove. You can do this by grinding D and C Rank missions, or by begging and pleading your village to give you one of each. Every village I've ever been in has had at least 10 of each. Once you have all three, you can complete some special missions that open up Reaper Missions.</p>
