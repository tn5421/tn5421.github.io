						 <p>Either bug report it, or it might be that some of them are considered to have only made it to Chunin (and then stopped playing) and are then questionable as a "real" referral. Not sure. Good luck.</p>

						 <p>Yes, I should have 5 acknowledged students. Out of the current 5 only 2 play true, but I have gotten the credit for all of the first 4. None are on the same I.P. and none are made by me.</p>

						 <p>Do you currently have 5 acknowledged students? and has a new dayroll passed since the 5th referral made it to Chunin?</p> <p>If you do indeed have 5 referral students, are any of them played on the same IP than Soiuku? If that is the care, it might be considered a true referral, and more a secondary character for you.</p> <p>If that is not the case, give it another day or so, and you "could" bug report it on your main page (lower left corner).</p>

						 <p>Well, a friend of mine in another state from me has just hit Chunin and it acknowledges him as my 'student' in the red box where you here tales from your students. However though, this would make him my 5th student but it gave no acknowledgment of me receiving a referral point for him, nor did I receive the Aura of Gratitude. Is there something I'm missing?</p>

						 <p>Is there a wait until you get your referral point(s)? I know that I had 4 a couple of days ago, because I have the Helper Pin, and the Coolness Badge. I know that I have 4 Referral Points because of the Tales of Students box, and it listed 4 names. There was a person who I referred and helped them to become a Chunin. They signed up through my link and became a Chunning around this morning after dayroll. So in other words, will I get my 5th referral point after the next dayroll or did I miss something?</p>
