						 <p>I wasted so many smokebombs looking for the mission and when I ran out I got him on a D20S16&#8230; And a message saying that I was at Crank 3.</p> <p>If your not getting the mission, then check your crank and do the math.</p>

						 <p>I found out (not sure if it's Dark Hour related or not) that Good Boy lv 1 can actually cheer for your opponent sometimes and give his successes to them. Was very annoying to find that on doing Tsukiyomi lol.</p>

						 <p>In the case of GB2, there was official confirmation that he existed. If GB3 were implemented, it's safe to say we would have gotten confirmation during the recent mass search for GB2.</p> <p>That said, following the example set by K-Dog-Lvl-2 (for which there's a picture, but also official word that he has NOT been implemented), one might make a case for creating a page for GB3 and not linking to it anywhere else. But I wouldn't go any further than that.</p>

						 <p>There is a picture for GB3, and because level 2 is in with just a picture, I think GB3 should be added as well. I just don't know how…</p>

						 <p>Just something to note. Tobi never refers to himself as a "Good Boy". It was actually one half of Zetsu referring to Tobi as such, but since Tobi's face was on-screen at the time (and on-panel in the manga), people assumed that Tobi called himself a "Good Boy". Admittedly, it's funnier that way, but…</p>
