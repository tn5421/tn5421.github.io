						 <p>Please attempt to use grammar, and try refraining from riding your high horse. That "<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">idiots</span>" at the end of your line isn't subtle just because you used strikethrough text, and gives people an excuse to not respond to your post or take it seriously at all.</p> <p>In regards to the point you were trying to make, I don't like to guess at what it may have been exactly. Whether it was due to a translation of his name, or just due to his characteristics, it's hard to say for sure without asking someone whom actually knows.</p>
