						 <p>While Spot and the "Let the Dogs Out" team bonus together with EDUT make it easier to find allies this way, this doesn't necessarily mean that it's an auto-get, EVEN if it worked for you on your first try. I know because trying it that way, I failed to get Triple H from the Training Missions while we had them.</p> <p>Just trying to keep in mind the possiblities here, though. Doing that would give you the best chance to get this annoying ally.</p> <p>Also, the Ichi Special Ramen helps as well, if you're still trying to get him. If you already got him, then good job :D</p>

						 <p>It would be awesome if I already had him and was just missing it for some reason, but I seriously don't have him… and I meant 'general' when I said I was spamming 'gen' missions… but then again, with 'genjutsu', I can see where the confusion would lie… and I really hope that wasn't just a pun because if it was, I might have to do the honorable thing.</p> <p>I think the reason it irritates me so much is because my Legacy and Red-eye alts both landed him either on the first try or within the first few days… and my white-eye character was the first one I made back in February. It's making me a little stabbity.</p>

						 <p>You are "spamming gen B-ranks" and should do general missions. He is rare and only found by doing general B-ranks.</p>

						 <p>I've been spamming gen B-ranks with my white-eye alt trying to get that perv to join my team. I have a couple of problems here. NOTHING I DO WILL GET HIM. I've tried white-eye AND EDUT with no luck! That says to me that the odds are less than 10%…</p> <p>and also, why is it that my white-eye alt can't get him, when the others have had him for WEEKS ;_; ~sorrow~</p> <p>argh.</p>
