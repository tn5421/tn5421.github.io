						 <p>Why change something that is not broken?</p> <p>If you create a post looking for some sparring partners, and you do it well, it fills up quickly. It is the post creator to come up with a good method to update his status, and to be swift in adding players.</p> <p>It took me about a week to get 30 partners, and I did not use any fancy post like you are proposing. And it was BvS and AV at the same time.</p> <p>Don't try to fix something that is not broken.</p>

						 <p>Require the Sparring/Animeversus Forum to be registered only, and adjust the "permissions" on the thread so the person who starts that thread can then delete posts..<br /> Reasoning:<br /> 1) If there is only 1 main post, that of the person's current status and/or people waiting to be added after they have added, it shows far more cleanly who remains to be added or not.<br /> 2) Makes people more likely to keep a thread updated accurately.</p> <p>On the same note, I'd suggest breaking up the Animeversus sparring and the billy sparring into 2 seperate areas, and make a standard format of "Player" and "Level" in each thread for that forum.</p> <p>Other than that, maybe a "1 week, no change = deletion" option to keep the number of threads in there downâ€¦.</p>
