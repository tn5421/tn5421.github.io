						 <p>Thank you for the help. I am going to try to get some things tomorrow to trade. I talked about the tote because I wanted to get the 'My Name Is' theme before I loop and I'd rather not have to go through this whole process another season. Sannin is going to be simple (in a way). I've already done that once before but I would like to get this theme though.</p> <p>If anyone DOES have any sham rocks, I will be back tomorrow to tell you what (should I have anything at all) to trade.</p>

						 <p>FoA is more expensive due to all that lost ryo … but really, I'd just say to push your sannin run back a week, and get the friend points to do it directly if you must. Toss J-Diddy in for better results, and Battle of Champions for even better…</p>

						 <p>It's not getting Right2 or Anonyomous2. It's getting the note, and with that, the Note Rush. +20% XP/AP FTW! I don't know why he mentioned the Tote.</p> <p>And Protip: If you want something, offering something in exchange makes people more willing to give it to you.</p>

						 <p>You have access to Outwiting the Best, therefor you have Obsessive Insight. Since that's the big benefit the Trade give to Sanin Runs, why does it matter if you get Right 2 and Anonymous 2 before or after you try for Sanin?</p>

						 <p>sorry I didn't mean looping but from doing my sannin run. Right now I need to build up for that. I'm S2 lvl 51 right now and I don't know if I have the time to get right and anon all the way to 70,000+.</p>

						 <p>A week from "looping" or a week from "hitting day 15 of my loop timer and being looplocked"? There's a big difference between the two.</p> <p>I don't have Makeout Mood Enhancers to spare, or even to use myself. You'd probably have better luck just trying to hang out with them using Friend Points.</p>
