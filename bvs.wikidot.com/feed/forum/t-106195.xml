						 <p>I happened to get a few note pages, and I need to use them for getting the Note by the end of the week. So, one day this week, I can bingo up to five people, but only if they are from a 45-50 person village (my village size is 50, so anything outside that range I can't spy on to try and set it up). Obviously, you also couldn't have your named obscured through the tools of the trade, or have the my name is theme set.</p> <p>Da Bolt, Underworld Village</p>
