						 <p>The worst I can see it getting realistically is "One day to hang out with one ally, then MOME or Stuffed Walrus for the other," or "Two days total to get enough FP to hang out with both of them."</p> <p>While it is true that as more people join, eventually get to the point where they have them and are running missions with them, the FP needed for hanging out is going to gradually rise, that is mostly handled by the scaling number of people the ally will hang out with. When it does get to those levels, people using MOMEs and Stuffed Walruses more often for them will also allow the FP needed for hanging out to drop slightly as well.</p>

						 <blockquote> <p>You can do both allies in one day from 0 friend points.</p> </blockquote> <p>We can do that today. We can probably do that tomorrow. Heck, we'll probably still be able to do it on Easter. But someday the game will have too many players to do that. It's a problem I look forward to, since by that time we should have at least 7K players and McM will finally be breaking even on the game.</p>

						 <p>And I suggest standard friend points.</p> <p>40K Friend points is easy with Battle of Champions, The Ninja-Mas Spirit, J-Diddy and TicTac.</p> <p>You can do both allies in one day from 0 friend points.</p> <p>Even if you have not enough stamina for one day run, make 25k fp(for each ally) in one day and rest next day.</p> <p>MOME or Stuffed Walrus for low friend level ally is wasteful.</p>

						 <p>Yes, having only one in your team, using one MOME, then switching to a team of only the other and MOME'ing them should work. Floating won't work because they both need to be in your team to get the hang out bonus.</p> <p>Otherwise, the only other way to hang out with them is FP, which using two MOMEs would probably be easier.</p>

						 <p>So I want to hang out with both haro and larry to get the special mission Wish around the world but when I tried putting them in my party it wouldn't let me because they fight so my question is can I use 2 make out mood enhancers to hang out with them for the special mission to show? If not what else can I do? Floating on air?</p>
