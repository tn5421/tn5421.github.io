The footsteps of other ninja.</p> <p><em>"Something you want to tell me?"</em> asked the rider. Shady Neo activated his White Eye and counted the ninja before saying "here come the last of our friends at the toxic village 30 in total, that should be enough."</p>

						 <p>As Shady Neo and the new horseman rode miles, they started to exchange information for their plan.</p> <p><em>"So, those are the 2 powerful ninja we need right?"</em> said the mysterious rider. "You got it in one," said Shady Neo "I just hope we can convince them to fight for the 2 of us." <em>"Well if we can't its your fault,"</em> said his companion with a grin <em>"oh by the way i found hecter 1690, no way will he ever find SNAKEMAN the way he is."</em></p> <p>"Thats good," said Shady Neo clearly releived "Now we can focus on our true plan. I just hope we can use these 2 on time, either way did you complete your part of the mission?" he asked already knowing the answer. <em>"Of course, what kind of idiot do you take me for?"</em>said the rider and then thought better <em>"Don't answer that."</em></p>

						 <p>They were coming, Shady Neo knew it. His time was coming to an end and if he stayed here much longer millions would die because of it. He knew they were coming to where he was, and it wasn't just an inkling, when he was in a fight with that person he let a hit get in at him. One touch was all that was needed to transfer a few millions of the bacteria he had crawling over his skin. And now he could use that bacteria for survalance purposes.</p> <p>Of course this was an intelligent ninja who would eventually figure it out but the bacteria had already served a useful purpose. And he was exited to try out that new Other Effect…</p> <p>But for now he had to run because there was an even more powerful ninja with him.</p>

						 <p>While all this was happening Shady Neo was several countries away in his Clone research lab. From here he had discovered many Clone related things. One of his greatest acheivements was the discovery of a substance which could extract blood from clones.</p> <p>But this was an experiment that if it went right, would give him more power than the limits of even HIM…</p>

						 <p>Hhehe.It isn't a shadow clone.Normal clone mate.Also,shadow clones don't give off blood from what I know.Anyways,I'll continue:</p> <p><em>"The man on the toilet looked up.Well,I'll have to go now.Can't use too much time here!"</em><br /> He got up and left(don't worry,washed his hands)</p> <p>He looked around him<br /> <em>"I wonder if <strong>he's</strong> in position now"</em><br /> Back at the forest,another man was watching the one that had recently come into contact with his ally.<br /> He looked at the battalion soldiers laying on the ground and at the surroundings…<br /> <strong>"Sempai didn't hold back this time now,strange.Generally,he doesn't use physical abilities to fight enemies.But it doesn't matter.I've been instructed to identify this guy for sure.He then got up.No point in staying here anymore.I have him figured out for the most part.Now I just need one more hint."</strong></p>

						 <p>And next thing he knew he was on the ground after being struck by one million palms. By the time he opened his eyes he was tied up and Shady Neo stood over him. "See how good a Clone Jutsu I have. Not only did it fool your now tied up dogs but it even fooled your White Eye."</p> <p>The man struggled but couldn't budge, "Oh and dont bother strugleing, those ropes are infused with micro-organisms that absorb chakra the more you fight the quicker you die." Shady Neo said. He then took out his trench knife and dug it deep into the ninjas thigh. "Ok I have all I need from you now."</p> <p>With that he produced a smoke bomb and performed the Escape Jutsu before the real ninja could attack him.</p>

						 <p>Meanwhile Shady Neo came to a sudden stop, he new the other ninja was powerful but alone he couldn't beat this army.</p> <p>Venom Village, the ninja village in Toxic country, had that name because they were masters of poison. He had dealt with cadavers of the victims of genin from that village, so he nknew a single drop could kill you. He had also heard a rumor that as a ninja ranked up in Venom Village, he was supplied with more powerful poisons.</p> <p>Shady Neo turned around and headed back towards his new friend, well he had already killed enough ninja from Venom Villageto have a 100million Ryo bounty on his head, what a few more million. He came to the spot of ground he could see from White Eye that his new ally was hiding. "Might want to watch out, these ninja are knowen for the poisons that tip every single one of their weapons, and they have been selectively bred over the last 100 years to be immune to it themselves." Get ready to fight an army of over 1000, and know that if you get scratched even once you will die."</p>

						 <p>The man looked around <strong>"20 countries?Blahh.How can he speak of 20 countries after me when he's got 50 on looking for his head on a silver plate"??</strong></p> <p>He looked around,and saw the man up about 500 meters up ahead.He knew he was of his clan aswell,although he had not known of him.He was surely using his WhiteEye to make sure to know if he was being followed by him,but also to keep track.He had gotten strangely more paranoid after the platoon had been broken up.It might've been a tracking force,and they would know that if it had been stopped in it's tracks,the man had help.He looked back up in the man's direction,1200 meters now.He looked up,sensing the man's chakra <strong>""Our clan has a distinct ability to sense others of our clan when they have their abilities activated</strong>""therefore the man would know if he were following him should he use the WhiteEye to track him.He turned off his WhiteEye,I can still track him by chakra if he has his WhiteEye active.He looked up,and in a flash he was gone aswell.</p> <p>As he neared he saw the difference in the timing of their footsteps in the ground,telling him the difference of their timing and therefore their speed.Using the info,he knew he had 20 seconds until he could be sensed through his chakra.He launched himself with all his strength into the ground,going through it using Earth Element techniques and deciding to follow under ground,where he stopped,took a scroll out and immediately rolled it onto the ground,a pack of dogs emerging.He gave them a piece of teh man's clothing that the platoon was using to track him <em>"GET HIM!"</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-705113-1" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" >1</a></sup></p> <div class="footnotes-footer"> <div class="title">Footnotes</div> <div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-705113-1"><a href="javascript:;" >1</a>.

						 <p>Shady Neo got upp looking bruised but otherwise uninjured, he turned on his White Eye and said "Thanks for the help, but unless you want 20 countries after you I suggest you leave me alone."</p> <p>"On the other Hand if thats what you want I suppose you could always help me find hecter1690, hes trying to find SNAKEMAN and I need to find him first or those two could cause the death of countless billions together."</p> <p>Shady Neo turned and said "If you want to help, your gonna need to keep up."

						 <p>As a silent ninja stood in the tree-tops,watching te man running he watched the army behind him using his WhiteEye.He smirked,got up,and used teh multiple shadow clone technique.He then used Water Style:Water Dragon Missile to intercept the army.Afterwards,each clone used te water clone technique to make 3 water clones.The water clones took each ninja in their respective teams of 3,and if 1 was destroyed,the other two would burst into water by their own free will,after which the shadow clone which made them would use the water to imprison the enemy ninja using the water imprisoment jutsu.</p> <p>Afterwards,the army was left scattered and bewildered as all clones disappeared,leaving smoke,and water.Then,they heard a loud voice.<br /> "Water Style:Giant water vortex technique",flooding them.After which,the voice was heard again-"Fire style:Immortal phoenix flames!",after which shots of fire burst into the ground from above,further confusing the army.Scattered,they turned to their leader for instructions—only to find he had been assasinated in the confusion.</p> <p>The real ninja then appeared in front of Shady Neo,quickly activating his WhiteEye and using his Elventy Billion palms technique,sending him through a tree and severing his chakra flow <strong>"Now,tell me why I just had to take down an entire platoon!"</strong></p>
