						 <p>Update again:<br /> We have defeated all the Minor Kaiju and have been summoning several of them more than once but got tired of beating on the same monsters every day. Because of this we bought the Elemental Beacon bringing us up to Tier 3. This means we'll be summoning Major Kaiju as well starting tomorrow morning.</p>

						 <p>Update 2:<br /> We're now 21 Ninja and bought our Epic Monument today bringing us up to 71 upgrades. We're summoning when we can and spare drops are handed out to villagers based on number of attacks. We are also currently on our first medium Zombja map.</p>

						 <p>Update:<br /> We still have 20 Ninja but we're up to 38 upgrades including BurgerNinja and PizzaWitch. Most likely we'll get the Nonja Lab this weekend and maybe even the Enticement Altar so we can start Zombjas and summoning again.</p>

					<![CDATA[
						 <p>We now have 22 Ninja in our Immortal Realm after gaining some new ones, 142 upgrades including BurgerNinja, PizzaWitch, Temple of the Four Winds (Mahjong), Enticement Altar, Epic Monument and our new Elemental Beacon.</p> <p>We're summoning most days and spare drops are handed out to villagers based on number of attacks though as we're just starting to summon the Major Kaiju there are no spares from them. We run regular medium Zombja maps with draws to select who launch the nuke or closes the gate. When we get the people to go through hard maps quickly enough we'll switch to that.</p> <p>Anyone that wants access to these upgrades as well as a friendly and active village with plenty of random chatter in the message board is very welcome to join.</p>
