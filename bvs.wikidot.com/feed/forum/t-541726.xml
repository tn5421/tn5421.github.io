						 <p>The original point to alt characters was to try out all three of the starter bloodlines, since this was before the loop existed to give you a chance to change it.</p> <p>Now a days, the only legitimate points to alts is to try out both options of the 'Choosing Sides' choice (Fate/Destiny), which is as of this typing still unchangeable, and to try various 'challenge' plays to see how much content you can complete. The current popular challenge is the no-mission challenge, where you do no missions at all (Quests are allowed, though since the Chunin Exam requires 40 D-Rank missions, you are locked at Genin.).</p>

						 <p>There isn't a point to alts as a means to help your main character. There are rules about alts and alt abuse in the forums and game ToS.</p> <p>I suppose the point of an alt character is to socialize in other villages, play in a &quot;hard mode&quot; (trying to complete everything low season), or maybe playing as a regular villager if your main is a kage. I play an alt to spend more time on the game after doing everything for the day on my main and since the completion difference between the two characters are so great I end up doing very different things on the two accounts.</p>

						 <p>alright, I've been playing for a little while now, but I haven't really been able to find anything that really details or explains the usefulness and point of having alts. what I mean is, what good do they do you/your main?</p>
