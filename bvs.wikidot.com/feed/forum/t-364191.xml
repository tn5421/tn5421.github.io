						 <p>One of the options:<br /> *You feel like you would have had more fun if your teammates weren't harshing your groove.. (randomly happen with teammates)<br /> has occured several times to me, but always when I had made 0 team changes that day.<br /> If I made just 1 chance I would get the +1 team change per teammate result (which set current at -2)</p> <p>EDIT: I just got the other option with 0 team changes that day. So it does not seem to be an aspect of this.</p>
