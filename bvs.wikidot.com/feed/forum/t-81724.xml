						 <p>the address of the page has an "s" in it while the title does not. While normally this would have little consequence, there are 2 pages already that link to "catgirl reservation" which end up not going anywhere since this page is under "catgirl reservations". It would be a simple matter to just go and change the links myself, but I'm not sure what the actual name of the village upgrade is in-game, so the actual address might need to be changed (if that's even possible). So I leave the task to someone who actually knows better. The two pages with broken links I spoted were:</p> <p><a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/upgrades">upgrades</a><br /> and<br /> <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/monster:agentbrand">agentbrand</a></p> <p>For the sake of sparing confusion for the time being, I updated the links to this page to include the "s", but if this is wrong I'd appreciate it if someone could update everything to how it's supposed to be.</p>
