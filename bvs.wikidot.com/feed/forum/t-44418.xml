						 <p>I'll still end up with it more than likely. Once I hit Chuunin i'll be using the Ro-Sham-Ro Redux but I'm going to switch to the love triangle once I'm high enough I think, so I would still have pinky in my party. And Stalkergirl :3</p>

						 <p>Ah, yeah. I can see that being an issue. That's actually why I went with <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/allies:mr-sandman">Mr. Sandman</a>. Gaara's just too cool to pass up. That, and I figured everyone would be going for <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/allies:emosuke">Emosuke</a>.</p> <p>Really, it doesn't make a huge difference. It's just 20 stamina if you have them in your party over night. I rarely make that happen, so I rarely get the bonus. Truthfully, I'd rarely get the bonus with any of the allies that were an option. I swap teams far too often :)</p>

						 <p>Don't get me wrong, I actually like Pinky's ability. I've got her and bugman on my team right now so I can use my White Eye twice without having to recharge stamina (farming D rank missions while I work on my chuunin exam) I'm actually picking up some decent stuff. Made a mint selling hell butterflys and those other butterflys. I just happen to like Stalkergirl more since Hinata is my favorite Naruto character. :(</p>

						 <p>That's something they added later in the V-Day holiday, mostly because people were finding they picked the wrong ally to celebrate V-Day with. Still, I wouldn't count anything out yet. They've said that the "crappy" choices are going to become much better.</p> <p>(BTW, I picked <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/allies:mr-sandman">Mr. Sandman</a>, so I can understand your pain!)</p>

						 <p>Really wish I had realized you could sell your V-Day item to redo the mission with another ally =/ Would have much rather had Stalkergirl than Pinky &gt;_&lt;</p>
