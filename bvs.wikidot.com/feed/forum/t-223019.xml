						 <p>You are correct. Your Range is the absolute limit of how high you can roll.</p> <p>In addition to zeroshadowragnarok's advice, another possibility is get to 11 Nin and become a Ninjutsu Special Jonin. That adds +2 Nin Range.</p> <p>However, there is another way that may (or may not depending on exactly how far along you are and what you've already done) be easier. The quest only requires 3 successes. While successes are rare and hard to come by, you <em>can</em> get three nin successes by purchasing the Arena item that gives you a Nin Success, and then getting two successes from your allies. Dueling Jonin (K-Dog and Bruce Sr.) gives you +1 Successes, in addition to the +1 Success K-Dog gives you. Combine that with the Arena Item, you have your free +3 Successes making range totally irrelevant.</p>

						 <p>get items like K-Dog's Headband. there's a few arena items that also increase your range. if you're in a good village you can buy a chakra armor for 20k ryo as well.</p>

						 <p>I'm on the Chunin mission "Walk the dog" and it requires 3 ninjutsu successes of 11 or higher. The problem is that my range is 1-10. I've tried equipping Emosuke, Master P and K dog, but even with their total +3 Ninjustu strength and one success, I can't win. I'm guessing it's because 10 is my max even if I had +1000 strength, so how do I improve this maximum?</p>
