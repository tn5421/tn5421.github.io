						 <p>You can join Tsuki if you choose. We are at about 30+ members regularly with 100+ upgrades now. We are very active and are doing zombjas(coordinated attacks) regularly. We entice kaijus(with a drop bidding system) and hold contests frequently. Of course we help each other as well, that is what being a village is all about ;)</p>

						 <p>Im a season 2 sp. jonin, very active (everyday). My village isnt very active or organized. Any large villages with lots of upgrades out there that are also active and have good teamwork looking for villagers? I also would really like a village w/ great teamwork on zombja maps, frequent kaijus and contests, and willing to help each other</p> <p>I can probably join in about 2weeks time when Im finished w/ current stuff.</p>
