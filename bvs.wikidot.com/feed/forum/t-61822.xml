						 <p>Eulers has become Erdos village in the Immortal Realm. We're still looking for members, and we're still good at math!</p> <p>129 upgrades and the membership fluctuates in the high 40's. Keep your eyes peeled for an opening and send an application!</p> <p>If you have any questions, try looking up the village in-game.</p>

						 <p>Eulers Village is looking to merge with a smaller village of about 15-20 peopleâ€¦ we currently have 32 active players and 48 upgrades, including some random kaiju upgrades. Please PM me to negotiate.</p> <p>Otherwise, anyone and everyone else is welcome to apply to join =) We're fun and we're good at math! xD Eulers Village welcomes both old and new players.</p>
