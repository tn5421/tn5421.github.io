						 <p>Also, if you level, for example, Billy to lvl 3, then he will no longer form any of his previous teams. Teams are very specific. You need the exact allies and no more.</p> <p>The only exceptions are Girl Power, which can be made with any three female allies, and Three Out Of Four, which can be made with any three of Flutie, Sticky, The Twins, and Tubby. Both of these teams can be made with allies of any level, provided they meet the other team criteria.</p> <p>Also, a 'real' team will override one of the previous variable teams. For example, Super Robot Girls gives you the Super Robot Girls bonus, but not the Girl Power bonus.</p>

						 <p>Teams have to have the exact members, no more and no less, for them to count as a team. So a 2 man team + 1 more doesn't count as a special team. Three different 1-man teams also doesn't count as a team.</p>

						 <p>No. If you have those three in your team then you will get no bonus. You cannot have two two-man team bonuses on a three man team. If there are 3 people on your team then they need a 3 person bonus otherwise they will have no team bonus.</p>
