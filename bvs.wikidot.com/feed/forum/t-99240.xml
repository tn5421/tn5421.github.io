						 <p>Whatâ€¦?</p> <p>Just bingo people. You don't need someone to hold your hand for it.</p> <p>The quickest way is to use Epic Dog Urination Technique and a Notepage at the same time. Just select the jutsu, check mark the notepage box, and click the link to use the notepage. Using that you can get 75 style points per bingo, but if they're already bingo'd you only get half of that. Using either by itself nets you more points then a regular bingo, around 35, but same applies if they are already bingo'd.</p> <p>Look for players who are also season 1 by checking their character page(by using the 'player lookup' feature). They will be easier to bingo. Bingo people close to your level or else you won't be able to track them. You should also make a good team that focuses on all stats and not just one. Besides that, just bingo a lot of people. You'll eventually get to 200 style points.</p>
