						 <p>Ok, I am not the village leader, but the actual leader seems to not be getting many people to blow up this village, and it's been happening for 4 months now. We need about 30 more people as everyone seems to be tired of waiting, so if you want to help out, get as many people as you can. We still fight kaiju during this period as well so you can get yourself some sweet item drops too.</p>
