						 <p>I usually don't advertise other villages on other forums, but I figure if there is a special section it won't hurt to put this out there.</p> <p>We are the village that more or less splintered off of the Wiki. It was planned the whole time with Uzuki. However, if me saying that we are a splinter group gets your attention then :D.</p> <p>Point is come here and enjoy a calm environment with fun and a fast track to WIN.</p>
