						 <p>Hello to all. After my old village went 'boom' today I have decided to take a shot at leading one myself. I hope for a new experience that comes with growth of a new village. All new villagers are appreciated (and needed ^_^). So if you want to help in development - from scratch to Epic, trash few monsters, raid few villages and have fun - hop on board - to Abyss Village.</p>
