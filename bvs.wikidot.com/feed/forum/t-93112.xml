						 <p>Ah. I tried looking at it from the Cowl of the Second HoCage page as well as the Indestructible Thread but neither had it set up right. Never thought to look at the snake rune page though. Thanks a lot Jadian.</p> <p>-Drivin-</p> <p><em>Update: I went around and adjusted the pages off the top of my head that I knew were wrong. However, upon looking closer at the link you provided, Jadian, I think someone needs to adjust that page's URL as it isn't formatted the same as all the other item pages.</em></p>

						 <p><a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/magical-hide-pattern">Magical Hide Pattern</a></p> <p>Though it wasn't linked to from the Cowl's page, it was linked to from the Snake Runes page. Someone just got things wrong when they tried adding the recipe.</p>

Currently, the wiki doesn't have this information and so i was wondering if someone could verify that I got the procedure correct and fill in the unknown item.</p> <hr /> <p>Cowl of the Second HoCage:<br /> *Ingredients-<br /> Snake Rune (Ancient Blueprints needed)<br /> Wasteland Hide Piece x6<br /> Indestructible Thread<br /> *Procedure-<br /> Wasteland Hide Piece + Wasteland Hide Piece = Two Wasteland Hides<br /> Two Wasteland Hides + Wasteland Hide Piece = Three Wasteland Hides<br /> Three Wasteland Hides + Wasteland Hide Piece = Four Wasteland Hides<br /> Four Wasteland Hides + Wasteland Hide Piece = Five Wasteland Hides<br /> Five Wasteland Hides + Wasteland Hide Piece = Six Wasteland Hides<br /> Six Wasteland Hides + Snake Rune = <em>???Unknown item???</em><br /> <em>???Unknown item???</em> + Indestructible Thread = Cowl of the Second HoCage</p> <hr /> <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p> <p>Thanks =)<br /> -Drivin-</p>
