						 <p>Kamkatana Village is in need of new and active Ninja. I have recently taken over as new Kage of the village and want to make it grow. We are a small village (6) with several upgrades but many of which have been disabled because of village membership size depletion. We need people who are active that can collect resources, patrol, etc of any Ninja level. If you would like to join us, please apply! ( I pretty much won't turn away anyone at the moment as long as they are active).</p>

						 <p>Shinogobmi village is also looking for members. Already have all village size 5 upgrades but only 2 people in village (most left and the other one is non-playing for a while, sadly enough).<br /> We have more than enough resources and ryo (lots in village and leader has over 150000 to invest in village) so once we get more members we'll instantly get new upgrades and into the war.</p>

						 <p>If advertising is allowed, then I would like to say that my main character's village, Quiet Village, needs some active members. Members, at least. We have tons of upgrades but due to lack of people they don't work, such as War Room, Potion Palace and Arms Depot. Currently we have 11 members, duplicate ip-players and lazy players are not counted.</p> <p>We also have an automatic +20 stamina bonus through the upgrade Tofu Shop.</p> <p>So, if you're looking for a nice village (especially nice if you're a beginner) with a laid-back atmosphere, please apply for the Quiet Village.</p>

						 <p>Then the only thing to warn you of is that we're not currently in the NWW. We should have the correct number of people for it after today, but we're still lacking the basic resources.

						 <p>I'm really looking for just a bit more community than my current village. I'm in the middle of the reaper stuff, then i'll be doing the trade, and it will be ages before I can even consider becoming a sanin, so i dont really see how i'd be that limited. I think I'd make a decent asset to a village thats just starting up, rather than a +1 patroller like my current village.</p>

						 <p>I've heard references to a Rogue Jonin mission line, but I don't believe it's complete yet. The only thing available as a Rogue Jonin that I know of is <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/mission:wake-the-snake">Wake the Snake</a> which you can use to get <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/allies:snakeman">SNAKEMAN</a>. If you do leave your current Village, you have to wait 2 days before you join a new one as well.</p> <p>Do what you think is best for you, while Wiki Village can always use more people to help, we really are just a starting Village. You'll be rather limited in what you can do for a bit until we get some upgrades.</p>

						 <p>Well, since everyone is doing this…</p> <p>:Ahem:</p> <p>Come and join Dark Star Village, I need more members, it haves Party House (and yes, it eats your money, but is worth it, I have The Rack and Yuri, and a member have K-Dog Headband), and that's all (the others upgrades aren't of much use to the members, but there is tha Hitaiate Maker, Banker and Collection Squad as well).</p> <p>Now, I'm thinking about going to a village in war for the test to become Sp. Jounin.</p>

						 <p>I don't really have friends so to speak in my old village. I'm friendly with all of them yea, but…not like…buddies or anything like that. And yea, your right, it would be tasteless ~_^ hence why I'm just asking for info hehe. I think i'll go hop off my current village then, I really do wanna come to this one. Sounds like you could use another Chunin :3 save me a spot in a couple days yes?</p>

						 <p>You hit the "Leave Village" button ;) You may have to enter your password as well. After that, there's a 2 day cooldown before you can join a new Village, so you'd be on your own for a couple days (which means tax free missions, woo!). Your headband also has a line drawn through the middle of it, to indicate you're a missing-nin.</p> <p>After that, it's just like joining a Village anew again.</p> <p>We'd be glad to have you on board, but I think it'd be really tasteless of me to try and talk people out of abandoning their current villages. If you think your interests would be well served by joining the Wiki Village, come on over! If you really have friends in your current village, or there are certain things you need to take care of (making Special Jonin &amp; Jonin, making the trade, etc), by all means, stick with your current Village.</p> <p>While I'm hoping Wiki Village grows quickly, we really haven't got <em>too</em> much to offer quite yet.</p>

						 <p>Wiki Village literally just came into existence last night, so we haven't got a whole lot going yet. There's two more Jonin coming over on Friday (2 day lockout from Village transfer), and probably a Chunin or two that I'm expecting to be joining up.</p> <p>Gonna need some time to get into the War though. That requires 10 people and a fair amount of resources. The goal is to rush to the war as fast as possible though (probably dangerously fast!).</p>

						 <p>If anyone is interested in joining a new village, or need one for a new character, I know a couple that need new members.</p> <p>Succubus Village is home to my main character. We just recently joined the Ninja World War and have about 16 members. We're gaining upgrades pretty quickly, so join up if you want to help up build a new major power in the war.</p> <p>Reiki Village is home to my secondary character and we just hit 7 members, I think. We're in desperate need of new members!</p>
