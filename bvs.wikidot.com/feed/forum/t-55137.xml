						 <p>It has always been a rare missionâ€¦<br /> It's easier to just bingo people until you get The Trade, then take Hyuk and Right on missions to get pages. You roll your attack before your enemy hits back, so even if you take more damage, you still have one extra round to kill them. Just pick targets from small non-NRF villages, because they have low HP.</p>

						 <p>I'm pretty sure it's been a rare mission for a while now.</p> <p>For season 1, getting note pages is kind of difficult. In season 2, it's easier since you can cheat the prize wheel, and you're more likely to do things like make the Trade, get the Note or get the Tote.</p> <p>I would suggest getting a Risky Badge from the arena, however. Having one, and a party like Ro-Sham-Bo Redux helps a ton for bingo'ing with Risky Badge.</p>

						 <p>Bingoing someone is so stupid that even if I get higher rolls in a stat the my foe I lose MORE hp then he does even if we started out equal HP. So I decided to hunt for note pages. FOR FIVE DAYS. and guess what? I only ever got the mission ONCE out of all the C-Rank gen missions ONLY ONCE did I ever get it. and even then no note page when I succeeded. Is there anyway to make this easier. I plan to use the Spot and Red Rover team and the Urine tech when I get it next time but how do I make it frequent? Seriously did they remove it and made it a rare mission?</p>
