						 <p>Short answer: Double chances</p> <p>Long answer: The percent additions are as a part of the original percent chance of the drop. So if there's a 10% chance of a drop, then drinking a chaser will give you 10% of 10% additional chance, which amounts to +1% on top of the 10% chance for 11%. Drinking 10 would double it to 20%. These bonuses are additive with themselves (as in, drinking a second won't give me 10% of 11%), but multiply with other bonuses.</p> <p>Drinks were not indended to be drank individually, but rather in large numbers and combined with other bonuses.</p> <p>For example, if there's really a 10% chance of a drop, then 10 Chasers + I Need This + HoClaus + Stand By Your Ninja + Olmek = 10% x 2 x 2 x 1.5 x 1.5 = 90% chance of getting 2 drops at once. Even if it's only a 5% base drop rate, you're still looking at a 45% drop rate after bonuses, which is fantastic for farming, especially with Olmek.</p>

						 <p>If I drink 10 chasers, do I have a 100% chance to get a drop, or just double chances?</p>
