						 <p>There's a bit more to it than that. First, you must have The trade (started by giving Hyuk 5 juicy apples). Then you can get Right via bingoing someone with a note page (and anonymous by being bingoed with a note page). I'm pretty sure that you need to bingo someone who is unbingoed, but since you have The Trade you can check out a village and see who's bingoed. Just look for the village with the most people around your own level and check it out. One of them will probably be unbingoed. Change that.</p> <p>Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to activate tools of the trade now.</p>

						 <p>I know that, in order to obtain <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/allies:right" >Right</a>, I must bingo a person with a Note Page while Hyuk is currently in my party; will I still get Right even if my target has been already bingo'd before me?</p>
