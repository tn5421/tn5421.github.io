						 <p>wow everything sounds so complicated they way you guyys put things lol.</p> <p>Basically,you have 3 spots.You have 4 if you get a bonus ticket.The first 3 can only be chosen from the top 3 lines,and the 4th one MUST BE from the 4th line.If it is not from the 4th line it isn't counted.If you fill teh 4th spot into one of te 3 lines,and all of your scratches are,say,blue potions,you do not win anything because of the mis-placement of te 4th scratch!</p>

						 <p>You only select 3 spots from the top 3 lines. If you select more then 3 only the first 3 you clicked are counted.</p> <p>The 4th place you choose from is from the bonus line at the bottom. If you have a rare super card the bonus line will have a potion spot and if you pick that spot plus 3 potions up top then you will the potion.</p>

						 <p>even when i buy the super ticket its still sometime just 3 blue potion and not 4.</p> <p>even when i choose 4 random spots.</p> <p>lets say i choose number 1&nbsp;2&nbsp;3&nbsp;4 ok? i get right at number 1 and 2 but wrong in 3, the 4th one would be right but instead i got number 3 and lost, you get me now? if i choose 4 spots i always lose, and sometimes there's only 3 blue potions, so whats the point then? is it a bug?</p>

						 <p>On the ticket you can only scratch 3 spots. The forth spot is on the fourth line. To be able to scratch to fourth spot you need to buy a Super Ticket. From 10 tickets I only got 1 with a blue potion on the 4th row so it is kind of rare.</p>

						 <p>On normal tickets there is 3/4 blue potions, but no blue potion multiplier. On a OMG ticket (rare), there is 3 blue potion, and a blue potion multiplier instead of a 3x multiplier, if i am not wrong</p>

						 <p>Now it says that you can pick 4 spots to gain the blue potions but you cant, it only goes with 3<br /> and when evreytime i pick 4 i always win but it takes one away from the super potion or the yoma blood so i dont win the item.<br /> some says that you can only win with 4 if you take the super ticket thing, well ive tried that and its still the same.<br /> and sometimes there isnt even 4 blue potions, sometimes its just 3 so you dont win it anyway, and you when you see that you could have won a super potion maybe, well you dont cause the it counts the 4th that was on the winning item goes away so you dont win it</p> <p>can somone give me a good exemplination about this?</p>
