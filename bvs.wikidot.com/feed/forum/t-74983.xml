						 <p>Well… not entirely true. You can use hottie regen as much as you want.</p> <p>However, once you use it, you enter a 'regeneration state', which is what actually gets you the stamina.</p> <p>Once in the state, you can continue to use the jutsu for the really weak other benefit it gives (+1 level, clearly a bargain at 200 chakra….).</p> <p>If this jutsu actually gave you 100 stamina every use, then sanin runs would be impossible. The math would just be wrong. Special Jonin would be making Sanin runs and in most villages, they wouldn't even need to have her as an ally.</p>

						 <p>Nope, it didn't work. You could only use Hottie regen once every two days, regardless of chakra cost.</p>

						 <p>so until a few weeks ago, you could use jutsu for zero chakra if you hang out with the one who teaches it, does this mean that if you hang out with the rack, you would've been able to use hottie regeneration however many times you wanted and so get as much stamina as you wanted?</p> <p>i know this is kind of a moot point now, but i just want to know, that would have made getting sannin insanely easy.</p>
