						 <p>It's been a while since I looped but I was fairly certain I was still doing NWW fights up to the day I looped on day 34 or so of my timerâ€¦I think that was before S1 NWW items looped, on the other hand. Perhaps it's been changed since then?</p> <p>Also, though that method does work and you would still be able to get the S2 NWW items after that during that season ( I believe ), you'd have to wait until you loop again to get the Warstruck theme. Just a heads up in case you were thinking of using it at some point.</p>
