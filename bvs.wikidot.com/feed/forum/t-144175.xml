						 <p>ok thanks for that, I thought it was an immortal realm village only thing. My mistake for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">interpreting the information incorrectly</span>, well I know i can at least do part of it. But am not at the right rank to unlock AA-Rank Missions, only got one of my characters to jonin so far. So that is another thing to add to my list, get to Sannin rank to open up AA missions, plus doing wasteland, burgerninja, reaper and other things &gt;_&gt;</p>

						 <p>There's a Village Upgrade you need to buy called 'Chaos Gate'. This costs 1 Million Ryo and 2 of each Advanced Resource.</p> <p>You don't need to be an Immortal Realm to buy it, but you do need both the Fox and Sand Demon Monuments.</p> <p>Being in a Village with the Chaos Gate and being S2+ opens up the Kaiju's Bargain quest.</p> <p>Completing it requires that you have an item called 'Errant Bit'. This item is obtainable through a rare AA-Rank mission (you'll know it when you see it). It's a Nin 25d25s Mission. It drops Errant Bit, but ONLY if your Crank is at 1+. There also happens to be an INCREDIBLY low chance of actually getting the Bit, so using the Power of Greass is highly reccomended.</p> <p>Completing the Quest grants you access to r00t.</p> <p>As for Immortal Realms, there is a special mission that the Sannin Kaijukage of an Immortal Realm can do that requires 100 Errant Bits, but to my knowledge nobody has completed it yet.</p> <p>You do NOT, however, NOT have to be in an Immortal Realm to start r00t.</p>

						 <p>Well if the first part requires S2+ then apparently S1 players are not even allowed to begin it.</p>

						 <p>Ya i'm close to ending it, it isn't hard at all, the first part requires you to be season 2+ and second part requires you to have one Errant Billâ€¦</p>

						 <p>I know this relates to immortal realm villages and from what my village leader has said on it, S1 and S2 players will find it very hard and are better off not attempting it. I am just wondering what you have to do for a full pass in the quest and which opens up the new area/content that is mentioned on the front page of BvS</p>
