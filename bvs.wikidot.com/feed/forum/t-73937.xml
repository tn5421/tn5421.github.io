						 <p>…*Facepalm*</p> <p>To start with…in "i never seen season 2 mission" it was meant that he/she has not seen the mission to become Season 2.</p> <p>Secondly, in addition to linking to the Looping guide page, seperating it more noticably from the other link you gave may have been nice, as well as possibly providing an answer to the main question, "How do you get to the next Season?"</p> <p>Thirdly: If you guys wants to start an arguement, then go start a thread for it in the Off-Topic section. There really is no need for that here.</p> <p>To the original poster: Once your Gen, Nin, or Tai reaches 18, you will see "Into the Loop" Special Mission. That mission will send you to the next Season. Each Season up to Season 4, that number increases by 3—so to get from Season 2 to Season 3, one of your three stats has to be 21 or higher.</p> <p>In later seasons, the difficulty and successes needed for regular missions increases by 1, but more content is available as well, such as the Monochrome stuff.</p>

						 <p>Please refer to this <a href="http://bvswiki.com/guide:looping">guide</a> for info on season 2, and <a href="http://www.correctenglish.com/">this one</a> (10 day free trial!) for correct English.</p> <blockquote> <p>(Also no offense, but just because you are online does not mean you need to throw out your intellect for the sake of getting a question asked. Good spelling and punctuation go along way. So try a bit harder to type out your words and such. Shorthand is fine, but not so good when you need help. Most people prefer to not have to pull out the "Websters Noob Dictionary" to figure out what was asked. Just trying to help from one person that used to type that way to another that still does.)</p> </blockquote>
