						 <p>That is indeed the Legacy version for both missions. Red&amp;White just have the hang out with Doughman requirement. I'll see if I can't make the changes later today.</p>

						 <p>Apparently, McM either decided to make a change to the mission "The Pants" (and possibly "The Pantsless too), or (more likely) Legacy have a different challenge than WhiteEye and RedEye because this is what I've got:</p> <hr /> <p>Genjutsu The Final Boss?</p> <p>You stand face to face with Mister Tea, the Lord of the Pantsless. "Why do you not join me? Taste the freedom of this brave world!" You leap to the attack, and he points his finger at you, eyes flashing to Bankai. "This hand of mine is Burning Red! SHINING-"</p> <p>Difficulty: 40 Successes: 40</p> <p>Ability #2: Taijutsu Difficulty: 40 Successes: 40</p> <p>A Specific Jutsu could help here..</p> <hr /> <p>Jutsu used: This Hand of Mine<br /> +100 Bingo Damage, Bingos self!</p> <p>This Hand of Mine<br /> Perfect Jutsu Application!<br /> Automatic win!</p> <p>Success! You counter his Jutsu with your own, World Versus World, and defeat him!</p> <hr /> <p>I would edit this myself, but I don't know if this is a Legacy only challenge or whether all of the bloodlines were changed to a perfect jutsu application. (Obviously, RedEye and WhiteEye would need a different jutsu because This Hand of Mine is Legacy only.)</p> <p>Also, I'm not familiar with the code to make the mission challenge boxes, and I think it's better that I don't try to mess around with it for fear of messing something up.</p> <p>Also, I can't verify that it's the same in The Pantsless, as I just completed The Pants. Someone else will have to verify that.</p>
