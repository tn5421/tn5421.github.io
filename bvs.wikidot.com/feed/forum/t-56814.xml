						 <p>It might be worth spamming B-rank ninjutsu missions if you're looking to do this too â€¦ there's a mission there that can give +20 stamina, and every bit helps. I'd say, though, that Legacy ninja have an advantage in this, with extra XP and an easier final check so Hottie Regeneration is easy to use. Of course, you could also keep the mission open for a couple of days to be able to use Jutsu again, but that's a last resort, I think.</p>

						 <p>Wait, I can't use more than on potion, since I need to be a Jounin to access the A-Rank Reaper missions, which are needed to get the hollow jaw's for the special missions. XD</p> <p>Sorry, if someone, who's willing to, could sort of do a step by step guide, I have quite alot of the permanent items, but not as many as i'd like.</p> <p>Got most of the level 2 allies, currently have 39 allys.</p> <p>If someone could just tell me the best way to get alot of stamina for the next day, then do a step by step guide to getting the 500,000 daily xp. I'd be ever so grateful.</p> <p>Thanks.</p>
