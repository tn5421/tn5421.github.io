						 <p>It was impossible until McMasters added Cobrakai. At that point, it became just a matter of time. To complete it you need:</p> <p>- All 3 Sannin themes (This means you must be at least season 4).<br /> - Bankai<br /> - Cobrakai<br /> - The Note<br /> - The Tote<br /> - Not Wasteland Disease<br /> - Eye of the Storm<br /> - An Epic Village with 50 Ninja in it (this means Epic Monument)<br /> - The Village must have at least 70 upgrades, 20 of which are kaiju upgrades<br /> - A full moon<br /> - Be Sannin</p> <p>Keep in mind, there's only been 11 people who've completed it thus far, and generally they've been regarded as the Leaders of the most successful villages in the game.</p>

						 <p>It is clearly obvious that the Impossible Mission isn't that impossible considering how many people have completed itâ€¦</p>
