						 <p>I know there are some mathematically inclined people on this board… Fax, Lear, I'm looking at you. Anyone else who wants to jump in, feel free.</p> <p>If you could, run through some numbers on Shikai vs. Bankai. I've done some number crunching, and I need to do more (which I will, when I have Bankai….). My initial assumption on Bankai was for killing monsters, bingo'ing, the new rolling mission, and anything else that needs tons of successes with a low diff. My numbers seem to indicate something else, though, so I'm looking for some second opinions.</p>

						 <p>You know, back when I was a Chunin and wrote this thing, it seemed perfectly obvious that the initial 10 Range was assumed. Plus I could leave that field blank and the calculations would still be run correctly. Ah well, live and learn.</p> <p>So, is that the general consensus that the calculator is in fact accurate, just counter-intuitive? Anyway, I have added a line at the top of the screen that says 'Your Initial Range (1-10) is already included', so hopefully that will cut down on the confusion.</p>

						 <p>No, I think the calculator is actually correct. I didn't understand the fact that it assumes a range of 10 and that it uses the input as a bonus.</p> <p>Putting in 12 instead of 2, for the range will certainly make the calculations a bit off….. okay, more than a bit.</p> <p>I've tried some of the old calculations that I did over a again, and it seems to reach the same end that the BvS poster had. That when you have little to no strength bonus already, the reaper blood is good, but the more powerful your strength becomes, the weaker the reaper blood becomes. It seems to be around 3 that the old Shikai became obsolete, Bankai was a waste at 2.</p>

						 <blockquote> <p>Ren Po Ken wrote the calculator, and I believe he's currently updating it.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is indeed correct. Right now, few people outside of Moon have access to the new calculator, but there are a number of changes happening to improve accuracy and add functionality.</p> <p>If you could contact him via PM, to let him know what is wrong, or PM me and I will get it to him about… 8 hours later. Yeah, you should PM him instead.</p> <p>It is possible bugs have been fixed already, just not integrated into the old calculator… but I'm not really savvy to the code. Check with him.</p> <p>Edit: I'm also talking him into posting instructions… Range on the calculator is the range bonus/penalty, the default 1-10 range is assumed.</p> <p>Edit the Second: Ren Po Ken knows about this thread now and he'll be going over it with a fine toothed comb. Some errors may be due to rounding, others to JavaScript core errors, others to him screwing up.</p>

						 <p>I think Anonymous here has it right.</p> <p>So simple, yet so utterly confusing. &gt;.&gt;</p> <p>Oh well, that seems to solve the problem.</p> <p>That also explains why all the numbers were off, but the trend remained the same. Increasing the range wouldn't affect which one is the best in most circumstances, because it benefits all of them, albeit not always the same amount.</p>

						 <blockquote> <p>I didn't even realize the BvS people actually came here also :P Sorta nice knowing they keep an eye on things.</p> </blockquote> <p>They don't. I directed them here via the suggestion box.</p> <hr /> <p>About fixing the calculator, I'm convinced there's something wrong with it. At the very least though, all (or at least the vast majority) of the calculations I had earlier seem to have at least gotten the general trend correct, even if the actual numbers are wrong. Fax's math proves that.</p> <p>Yeah, I'm checking calculations and it's definitely off….. way off.</p> <p>Anyone think that they could possibly contact the person who coded that and let him know he's WAY off? Judging by the info below the calculator, it seems as though it hasn't been updated in a while, so I think it's unlikely that anyone'll be able to contact him. Regardless, the calculator should probably be taken off the site seeing as the information it yeilds is wrong.</p>

						 <p>New Reaper Blood Stats:</p> <p>Shikai (-1 Levels, +2 Strength)<br /> Bankai (+5 Levels, -2 Strength)</p> <p>Odd. I would have expected Bankai to be strictly better than Shikai (that's how it works in Bleach), but I think I prefer it like this. This way, you will actually have reason to use both, depending on what kind of mission you need it for. Most people will probably use Shikai for most normal missions, but I can see how Bankai could be very useful for Bingos and Monster battles.</p>

						 <p>Here's the deal *grabs papers on Reaper Blood*-<br /> Reaper bonuses are tradeoffs.<br /> Generally, you are giving up X possible successes for a bonus to all the remaining 'Success-Chances'.<br /> 10 dice, 10% chance of success = 1S on average.<br /> 6 dice, 20% chance of success = 1.2S on average.</p> <p>HOWEVER.</p> <p>Each point of strength is worth LESS than the last. This was not true at the time Reaper was written.<br /> assuming you need a max roll on a 10-chance (10% to win), the first point of Strength adds a 100 bonus to your success chance. the next, 50. the next, 30.</p> <p>The gam has enough strength bonuses that the Reaper stuffs is taking you not from 0 Strength to 2, but 4 to 6 - and, that is right, it isn't worth it at that point. Of course, this only counts if you look at reaper as the 'last' bonus instead of the first, but since it is often the only one you are paying something for, that's a fair way of looking at it.</p> <p>As such, we're looking into a change. Stay tuned.</p>

						 <blockquote> <p>i'm only special jounin so don't mind me if the following is different for higher ranks. but for me the dif for NWW fights is pretty low. so actually i'd kinda think<br /> that more lvls is always better for those?<br /> and for sparring i'd kinda think the same?</p> </blockquote> <p>NWW fights don't use permanent items, which is what reaper blood technically is, so NWW fights aren't affected by your Dormant/Shikia/Bankai status.</p> <p>Sparring is essentially the same as a mission, except you don't know beforehand how many successes you'll need to win. If your opponent can get, say, 11 successses with a difficulty of, say, 9, then winning the sparring match is essentially the same as passing a D9 S12 mission, so there should be no difference between sparring and an equivilant mission.</p> <p>I'm trying to think of this a little different, and Fax's calculations have triggered some thoughts in my head. Essentially, to determine how good something is, you're multiplying the expected success rate with the number of tries, as Fax has done. It seems like a maximizing the area problem, but the trade offs aren't equal. To get one more length you need to give up 2 height, so to speak. The objective is to find which combination gives you the most area within your hypothetical box, an objective made more difficult by the fact that there's no -2 levels +1 strength reaper blood, which would probably be more useful for general missions.</p> <blockquote> <p>Difficulty 12, 15 levels, +4 str, range 12.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Dormant: 1d12+4 (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12) = 5/12 chance of success per die (41.6%)<br /> Shikai: 1d12+6 (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12) = 7/12 chance of success per die (58.3%)<br /> Bankai: 1d12+7 (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12) = 8/12 chance of success per die (66.6%)</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Dormant: 15 chances at 41.6% of success = ave. 6.24<br /> Shikai: 11 chances at 58.3% of success = ave. 6.41<br /> Bankai: 9 chances at 66.6% of success = ave. 5.994</p> </blockquote> <p>5 Successes:</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>99.8829% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>99.5717% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>98.6952% chance of success</strong></p> <p>10 Successes:</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>66.6408% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>24.8412% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>0% chance of success</strong></p> <p>Again, the calculator conflicts with your results, which is strange because I can't find any error in your calculations. I'm starting to think that there might actually be some flaw with the calculator. I'm not sure. I'm a little busy today, but when I find the chance, I'll do a few calculations to make sure the calculator is accurate. If it's not, then someone should probably notify the person who wrote the code for that. I could even email the guy the correct calculations to use in the code if he'd update it.</p> <p>Of course, that's assuming he's wrong. I'm thinking there might be some basic statistics rule that we're forgetting here.</p>

						 <p>i'm only special jounin so don't mind me if the following is different for higher ranks. but for me the dif for NWW fights is pretty low. so actually i'd kinda think that more lvls is always better for those?</p> <p>and for sparring i'd kinda think the same?</p> <p>i just wanted to state what i intuitively think before someone actually finds out using this math stuff (sorry i'd calculate myself but i just wrote a test on that crap and had one of my 5 "abiturprüfungen" (i don't know the english equivalent but they are the german graduationtests - tough s***), so i have pretty much dough lurking around in my head ^^</p>

						 <p>That's a very interesting analysis - thank you very much!</p> <p>Have you looked at competitive rolls, as well - where success is defined whether you score more successes than your oponent (sparring, NWW)? In your analysis you look at beating a mission (# successes at set difficulty). But what if you have someone rolling against you? Intuitively, I'd think that more strength is beneficial here, but going over your maths, I'm not so sure anymore.</p>

						 <blockquote> <p>Strength does not raise the minimum bar, as stated in the FAQ: rather, it adds to every roll.</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm aware of how Strength works. I think you misinterpreted what I meant. What I meant is that adding 1 strength and subtracting 1 difficulty will actually have the same effect, assuming your range is high enough to reach. It really doesn't matter though, since I used the calculator for everything, so even if I had misunderstood it, it wouldn't change the calculations.</p> <p>"My Tai Stats (including all items except Reaper Blood): 20(+3) levels, 14 range, +3 strength, 1 free success<br /> My Team Bonus (only Tai affected): Billy Lvl. 2 + Emosuke Lvl. 2 = +4 range, +2 strength, 1 free success</p> <p>Total Stats with items, team, and Dormant: 23 levels, 18 range, +5 strength, 2 free successes<br /> Total Stats with items, team, and Shikai: 19 levels, 18 range, +7 strength, 2 free successes<br /> Total Stats with items, team, and Bankai: 17 levels, 18 range, +8 strength, 2 free successes</p> <p>(it occurs to me now that your calculated strength bonus is incorrect and I have fixed it here)."</p> <p>I'm sorry, that was a typo. All of that was entered correctly into the calculator. Because teammates and item bonuses are entered separately, I must have neglected to add them when I was typing my post. My bad. Though you're correction of my levels is off. It was 17(+3), not 20(+3).</p> <p>Regardless, I think the calculator is accurate. I had my doubts at first, particularly because it occasionally yeilds a nonzero (albeit small) success rate when the difficulty exceeds your range. Otherwise, it seems to be pretty much on though, and considering that the calculations to do it manually and the programming for such a calculator are not all that complex, I find it hard to believe that an error exists with it that has not yet been caught (aside from what I already mentioned).</p> <p>Hmmm…. your 28 difficulty interests me. I probably should have tested it at the max, but lets try it now. I realize you were trying to avoid the calculator, but considering that it's nearly 1 AM, I don't care to do the calculations manually (because I'm friggin' tired). Putting into the calculator with various successes needed:</p> <p>5 Successes:</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>99.9799%chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>99.9475% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>99.8942% chance of success</strong></p> <p>10 Successes:</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>86.8512%chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>75.0998% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>63.263% chance of success</strong></p> <p>15 Successes:</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>13.1588%chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>2.949% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>0.5314% chance of success</strong></p> <p>Adding 5 more would make Shikai and Bankai impossible and Dormant would essentially be impossible just because of the increadibly low success rate.</p> <p>Yours and mine seem to conflict though. That is a puzzler. I'll check it tomorrow when I'm better rested.</p>

						 <p>I'm curious as to the accuracy of the calculator.

						 <p>Intuition tells me that a stronger reaper blood (that is, Bankai/Shikai) would always be a good thing, but I'm beginning to have doubts about it. In fact, I'm finding that (at least for a high level jonin) having even Shikai would make a character weaker for the vast majority of missions, and Bankai seems to be even worse.</p> <p>I want to run some ideas by the people here, if you don't mind.</p> <p>Obviously having a reaper blood that is too high for your current levels would be a bad idea. The level penalty would just make it near impossible to complete anything. (Imagine a level 35 ninja running around with an 18 level penalty from Bankai… well more like a 12 level penalty after you factor in the sword, but you get my point.) For that reason, I've been avoiding using bankai. I already have a (-1) penalty to all levels from Shikai and I'm wary of making it worse. However, I had figured that, when taking a more difficult mission (ie. A ranks or, heaven forbid, S ranks), the (+1) strength from going from Shikai to Bankai would outweigh the (-2) levels penalty. So, using the mission calculator, I ran some tests, and I was, to say the least, surprised.</p> <p>In EVERY scenario I could come up with, using Bankai gave me a WORSE probibility of succeeding than I had with Shikai.</p> <p>This led me to the obvious conclusion: For a jonin of my strength, Bankai is inherently WORSE than Shikai in all but perhaps a few select scenarios.</p> <p>Well, the next logical step would be to say that Shikai is inherently WORSE than the Dormant that is but a faint memory of long ago by now. I didn't want to assume it, fearing that I had made some grave error in my logic, so I ran a few tests on this as well, and the results came up just as my conclusion said they would, Shikai DECREASED my chances of being successful on EVERY hypothetical* mission I tested.</p> <p>(*Note: Every time I mention "hypothetical missions" I am referring to an imaginary mission with a difficulty and successes needed that I chose to suit my needs, which may or may not fit any particular mission available at the current time.)</p> <p>I'm going to list some of the results from my calculations here, so everyone can see the same numbers I'm seeing. I start with a hypothetical run on the A rank, Withstand the Eyepatch of the Soul! with my current stats, and do some modifications to test other possibilities. I also test some other hypothetical missions, most of which would be significantly easier than the aforementioned mission. However, to make sure there were no holes in my theory, I also tested hypothetical missions which would be MORE difficult than the aforementioned.</p> <p>Warning: The following paragraph contains a parenthesis within a parenthesis within a parenthesis. Read at your own risk.</p> <p>So that everyone is aware of what stats I am using in these calculations, here they are (I am only using the Tai stat for calculations, since, theoretically, tai could be swaped for any other stat and everything would be nearly the same. (The only difference would be team, and that should be relatively minimal. Jutsu wouldn't play a signficant role because, with the exception of Kido:Nightfall, which is really only needed on Withstand the Eyepatch (at least within mission ranks D through A), there is a Gen and Nin equivilant for every particularly useful Tai jutsu.)):</p> <p>My Tai Stats (including all items except Reaper Blood): 17(+3) levels, 14 range, +3 strength, 1 free success<br /> My Team Bonus (only Tai affected): Billy Lvl. 2 + Emosuke Lvl. 2 = +4 range, +2 strength, 1 free success</p> <p>Total Stats with items, team, and Dormant: 20 levels, 18 range, +3 strength, 2 free successes<br /> Total Stats with items, team, and Shikai: 16 levels, 18 range, +5 strength, 2 free successes<br /> Total Stats with items, team, and Bankai: 14 levels, 18 range, +6 strength, 2 free successes</p> <p>In all of the following calculations, I am using the stats above which correlate to the proper reaper blood mentioned, unless I specifically state otherwise.</p> <p>Starting with Wistand the Eyepatch (Ignoring Gen, since it would be near impossible to fail that part):</p> <p>Jutsu used: Kido: Nightfall = +3 strength, +10 range</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>80.3301% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>45.3567% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>17.294% chance of success</strong></p> <p>As you can see, Dormant has a significantly greater chance of success than the others. Now, testing to see if that changes under a higher difficulty.</p> <p>Hypothetical mission: Difficulty:25 Successes: 15</p> <p>Jutsu used: Kido: Nightfall = +3 strength, +10 range</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>34.2593% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>10.4046% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>2.3562% chance of success</strong></p> <p>None of them have a high chance of success (as expected), but Dormant still beats out Shikai by a ratio of more than 3:1. Now testing to see if Reaper Blood is worth it when more Successes are needed:</p> <p>Hypothetical Mission: Difficulty: 20 Successes: 17</p> <p>Jutsu used: Kido: Nightfall = +3 strength, +10 range</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>45.7367% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>7.8973% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>0% chance of success</strong></p> <p>This one's even worse for Reaper Blood. Dormant still has nearly a 50/50 chance of passing, whereas Shikai is a long shot, and Bankai is simply impossible. I will admit however, those missions were pretty Tai specific, since that kind of range can only be attained by Kido: Nightfall (unless you've learned Emosuke Lvl. 3's jutsu). So this time testing a few missions that aren't quite as difficult as Withstand the Eyepatch. I will use no jutsu since, theoretically, using a +2 strength jutsu on a level with a difficulty of, say 15, would merely reduce that difficulty to 13 (not technically, but as long as you have the range, it shouldn't make a difference either way. You can plug it into the calculator if you don't believe me.) The same would apply to free successes. Levels added through jutsu would also be related to the successes, but in a slightly indirect way. I'll test those though, just to be sure. So, anyway, the tests:</p> <p>Hypothetical Mission: Difficulty: 15 Successes:10</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>99.7412% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>99.253% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>98.3039% chance of success</strong></p> <p>Again, Dormant wins. It's a slight difference, but enough to make you loose an extra mission every couple of days. Testing on a mission that's more success heavy:</p> <p>Hypothetical Mission: Difficulty: 10 Successes: 15</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>99.5636% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>97.6369% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>91.2642% chance of success</strong></p> <p>Dormant is still the highest. Again, a slight difference between Dormant and Shikai, but Bankai is a killer, making you lose roughly 1 in every 11 missions (assuming no jutsu is used). Testing a higher difficulty that also has a high number of successes:</p> <p>Hypothetical mission: Difficulty: 15 Successes: 15</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>70.2917% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>40.4987% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>16.466% chance of success</strong></p> <p>Okay, I take back what I said about Bankai beging a killer in the last one. This mission turns a relatively safe success into a near certain failure. Hardly the benefit players are going for. Alright, now testing what happens when you add (or subtract) levels to(/from) the character, whether via jutsu or just plain leveling up (assume the old stats, just add/subtract the levels in mentioned before each hypothetical mission) I'll use a D17 S12 for the following because it seems like an upper difficulty A rank mission (upper difficulty needed because percents will be very high when I'm adding levels) :</p> <p>ADD: +3 levels (Total levels = 23 w/o reaper blood)</p> <p>Hypothetical Mission: Difficulty: 17 Successes: 12</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>97.0269% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>94.8629% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>91.806% chance of success</strong></p> <p>They're all high, but Dormant is the highest. Adding more levels:</p> <p>ADD: +5 levels (Total levels = 25 w/o reaper blood)</p> <p>Hypothetical Mission: Difficulty: 17 Successes: 12</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>98.9163% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>98.4293% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>97.6708% chance of success</strong></p> <p>Dormant is still the highest, but by a slightly lesser margin than before. Perhaps if we increase levels more Shikai and Bankai will surpass Dormant? Adding more levels:</p> <p>ADD: + 10 levels (Total levels = 30 w/o reaper blood)</p> <p>Hypothetical Mission: Difficulty: 17 Successes: 12</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>99.9354% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>99.9486% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>99.9443% chance of success</strong></p> <p><strong>Dormant is FINALLY surpassed by both Shikai and Bankai, but by this point it doesn't matter. The difference between Dormant and Shikai (which is at this point higher than Bankai) is only slightly more than 0.01%, or 1 in every 10,000 missions. Why do they finally surpass Dormant, and why is Shikai higher than Bankai? My best explanation is thus: All three, as levels are increased, eventually converge at 100%. That is to say, they never reach 100% exactly, but if you were given an infinite amount of rolls, you would have a 100% chance of passing the mission. Well, Bankai and Shikai have a higher strength number, and as the number of levels are increased, each individual level becomes more and more insignificant (compare a genin with 3 levels in a stat to a jonin with 15, 16, 18, etc.). That means that the strength comes more into play in determining success ratio, and so Bankai and Shikai converge FASTER than Dormant, but they all still converge, and for the numbers that make a real difference (at least less than 99.9% or so), it seems that Dormant will always be higher than Bankai and Shikai.</strong> Theoretically, range should also converge. It's not as intuitive as it is with levels, but I'm about 99% sure the success ratio will converge at 100% as the range becomes infinitely high. Strength will NOT converge. It will actually hit 100%, but it doesn't converge. (If you don't understand the mathematics behind that, don't worry. It's not particularly important whether a stat converges or hits 100% at a non-infinite number. The end result is essentially the same.) Just to be sure, a few more tests for lower leveled ninja. If my hypothesis is correct, Dormant should be much better in these next two calculations. I'll keep the misson difficulty and successes the same:</p> <p>SUBTRACT: -3 levels (Total levels = 17 w/o reaper blood)</p> <p>Hypothetical Mission: Difficulty: 17 Successes: 12</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>66.3227% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>35.6082% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>13.3348% chance of success</strong></p> <p>So far so good. Making sure the same trend occurs as more levels are decreased:</p> <p>SUBTRACT: -5 levels (Total levels = 15 w/o reaper blood)</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>42.5539% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>8.7233% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>3.4572% chance of success</strong></p> <p>And it seems that Dormant wins for these as well. If I decrease it anymore, it'll become impossible for Shikai and Bankai to get the required successes, so I'll stop decreasing levels here. But what if the player was significantly weaker. For these missions, I'll drop my Emosuke/Billy team. I'll ignore the Ring of Power I have as well, just to simplify things.</p> <p><strong>NEW STATS (w/o reaper blood): 20 levels, 14 range, 3 strength</strong></p> <p>Hypothetical Mission: Difficulty: 12 Successes: 7</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>99.9121% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>99.8356% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>99.6849% chance of success</strong></p> <p>Dormant still wins in this situation. Perhaps if I only had a range of 12.</p> <p>NEW STATS (w/o) reaper blood: 20 levels, 12 range, +3 strength</p> <p>Hypothetical Mission: Difficulty 12 Successes: 7</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>99.7679% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>99.6653% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>99.4411% chance of success</strong></p> <p>Dormant still wins. What if I had no strength boosters now? What if I was just a level 60 jonin with no permanent items (or rather, a level 51 jonin with the sword and soul glove)?</p> <p>NEW STATS (w/o reaper blood): 20 levels, 12 range</p> <p>Hypothetical Mission: Difficulty: 12 Successes: 7</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>94.2341% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>93.2261% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>90.7571% chance of success</strong></p> <p>Still Dormant Wins. Okay, what if I was only a level 36 (27 plus sword and glove) chunin?</p> <p>NEW STATS (w/o reaper blood): 12 levels, 10 range</p> <p>Hypothetical Mission: Difficulty: 10 Successes: 7</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>52.693% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>16.9127% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>0% chance of success</strong></p> <p>Still, Dormant is by far the best. Bankai doesn't even have enough levels to succeed at the mission. Now, I've tried high difficulty missions, high success mission, but not paritularly low difficulty or low success missions. Those will be next:</p> <p>Hypothetical Mission: Difficulty: 5 Successes: 6</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>99.6097% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>96.1908% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>73.5092% chance of success</strong></p> <p>Still Dormant is better, perhaps if the difficulty were lowered one more:</p> <p>Hypothetical Mission: Difficulty: 4 Successes: 6</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>99.9328% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>99.4212% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>100% chance of success</strong></p> <p>At this point, Bankai is the bes because quite frankly, it's impossible to fail. However, Dormant is more than 99.9%, so there's still a very small difference between the two. Now what if the number of successes needed was very low?</p> <p>Hypothetical Mission: Difficulty: 9 Successes: 2</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>99.9681% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>99.871% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>99.5361% chance of success</strong></p> <p>Dormant still is the best. Lets see if it makes any difference if it's one success:</p> <p>Hypothetical Mission: Difficulty: 10 Successes: 1</p> <p>Dormant Reaper Blood = <strong>99.9931% chance of success</strong><br /> Shikai Reaper Blood = <strong>99.9775% chance of success</strong><br /> Bankai Reaper Blood = <strong>99.9271% chance of success</strong></p> <p>Dormant is still the highest, though at this point (and with the previous as well) it's basically an auto-win.</p> <p>I could test other scenarios, but there's nothing that I could test that would really show us anything that can't be deduced from the other calculations. I can't reduce the levels any more because that would make Bankai and eventually Shikai give you so few levels you just can't complete the missions anymore. Decreasing the difficulty any more would still result in a &gt;99.99% chance of success, something I'm certainly not complaining about, and you can't go lower than 1 success. I think I've already adequately tested the higher range, with a few that had a very high difficulty and some with a very high amount of successes. I also think I've adequately hit the different focuses of missions (ie. low success, high difficulty versus high success, low difficulty), so I don't think there's much more to check there.</p> <p>Basically, I'm forced to conclude that <strong>Reaper Blood - Dormant is, in every possible situation that actually matters, superior to both Reaper Blood - Shikai and Reaper Blood - Bankai.</strong></p> <p>So, to those of you (if there are any) that had the patience to actually read all that, I pose the following question: Can you prove me wrong? I don't think so, but you never know. Maybe there is a character out there who actually benefits from Reaper Blood. I may have wasted the past 3 hours working on my theory, and if so, I'd like to hear your refutation to my theory.</p> <p>Otherwise, I think McMasters, despite his infinite wisdom, has made a tiny blunder, and accidentally created an item that actually WEAKENS your character. Or maybe it wasn't an accident.</p> <p>Edit: I should note that all of my calculations are from the calculator provided at <a href="http://bvswiki.com/utility:calculator">http://bvswiki.com/utility:calculator</a>. If there's some flaw with that calculator then, of course, all of my calculations are off, and this entire post becomes pointless. I'm placing my faith in Ren Po Ken's mathematical/programming abilities here.</p> <p>Edit 2: Okay, I've just proofread it for errors once, and I don't care to do it again. As such, please excuse any bad grammar/spelling/whatever. If any of the numbers are off (because I could have typed one wrong) though, let me know.</p>
