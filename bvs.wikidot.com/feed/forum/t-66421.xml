						 <p>It says that the Dalai Lama was added, however, for political correctness, it should be noted it was the 14th Dalai Lama added. Why?</p> <p>The Chinese government decided, in or around 2007, that THEY should choose who the preachers area — a government-ruled religion. The Dalai Lama said no, as well as making attempts to end half of the Dalai movement — specifically, the Dalai Lama is both a person and an organization, both of which exist for the people rather than for themselves. The 14th Dalai Lama thought that the human Dalai Lama was no longer needed, and declared that he ight be the last Dalai Lama. His awesomeness comes from his rejection of China's government—one man versus a bloody MOUNTAIN. The 14th does not believe that the Lamas should continue, but if they do, then the next Dalai Lama might be government controlled.</p>
