						 <p>As of right now, Pheonix Village has five members, and one upgrade. Starting a village is REALLY HARD, so please join up, and experience the wonderful feeling of watching our village grow, and know that you were one of the people who made it possible! I also know a lot about Billy vs Snakeman, so if you need any help, don't be afraid to ask. Thank you for viewing this thread, and please, please join up!</p> <p>Thank you for your time and patience.</p>
