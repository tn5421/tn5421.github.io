						 <p>I'll still be logging in at least once a day, just won't be constantly around like I usually am. By my napkin math, I think we'll be ready for SWATBU on Friday or Saturday, and the NRF by Sunday or Monday, depending on how things fall out (and if the votes go the way I want them to).</p>

						 <p>For the moment, I just want to make sure there are enough spies out in the world that if we are in a position where we need resources for an upgrade, we don't have to wait 24 hours to get the spies into position (and risk getting our invaders bingo'd in the process). So, once a day at least check to see how our spy situation looks. Right now, it looks okay (though a little heavy in crystal targets, not enough water and metal targets). If a bunch get detected during the day roll, we should send out some more.</p> <p>I guess we should try to be in a position where we always have at least 3 permanent spies available in good targets. Good targets being ones that we won't have too much trouble invading and aren't producing crystals. If there's 3-4 of us working on that, it probably won't even require that we all spy every day.</p> <p>Regarding spying…I'd prefer you spy on Villages that won't get you bingo'd over Villages that are easy to invade.</p>

						 <p>After looking at the attack menu it doesnt seem to bad. As far as placing spys, is that something you'd want us to do once a day, or what is preferred? And with spying are we trying to target the small villages that will be easy to attack? Or mediumish villages which will be easier to spy on?</p>

						 <p>The plan for right now is to wait until we have 200,000 ryo, or we're fairly confident we'll get it in the next day roll. The two leading candidates for our next upgrade is the Potion Palace and the Arms Depot. Both of them require 200,000 ryo and at least 1 of each resource that we can't produce.</p> <p>The <em>best</em> way to do that is to hit 2 different Villages before a day roll and then 1 more after a day roll, but that's not always an option. For that to work, I need to have an invasion target set on day #1 where we don't attack anyone. Then on day #2 around 30-60 minutes before the roll, we hit the Village from the target on day #1. Then we switch the target to a new target and hit that Village as well. Then, after day roll, we change the target again and hit a new Village.</p> <p>Preferably we hit as <em>few</em> as possible to get the resources we need for our upgrade. Usually when you hit a Village, they'll want to retaliate.</p> <p>Given our current ryo rate, it looks like we'll probably be ready for our next upgrade probably on Tuesday, possibly Wednesday. Depends how the prize wheel goes, mostly.</p>

						 <p>There's not a whole lot to explain about Invading/Attack. Once we have a spy in a Village (not just infiltrating, but actually in), the attack menu becomes available. When you're there, you can see what Villages we have the option of attacking. Each Village will have a difficulty and a success requirement, just like a normal mission, except this one is in Gen, Nin and Tai all at once (with all the same stats for all three attributes).</p> <p>When you go for the attack, you can use your items, but no allies (except for certain Summons, which we don't have yet) and no jutsu. The smaller the Village, the easier it is to invade. The larger it is, the harder (but it's easier to get spies into larger Villages, harder to get them into smaller ones).</p> <p>An attack takes 50 stamina, but it's free to check out the difficulty (unlike spying). You can also check their resource and if they have things like creepy traps or spy towers, etc. Success or failure removes the spy from that Village. If it's the invasion target that I've set, you can take some of their resources. If it's not an invasion target, you just get some ryo. Personally, I think spies are too valuable to give up just for some ryo, so I'd prefer we stick to only hitting invasion targets, and then only at times when we need resources for upgrades.</p> <p>There are, of course, upgrades that make invading easier for us.</p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> I've given both Schon and Jupiah attack permissions to check out what the interface looks like. Please don't attack any Villages unless it's part of the plan. Like I said, spies are more valuable than ryo, and it's best for us to not hit other Villages for their resources until we have the ryo such that we can purchase an upgrade immediately.</p>

						 <p>I'm in the same boat as Jupiah. Hell I've never even tried to bingo anyone. Sometimes I am unable to check the forums on Sundays, but other than that I check in more than once a day.</p>

						 <p>I'm game for it. I fit every requirement except 3. I'm not sure how to invade villages, and I've only tried to bingo someone once before (I failed). If you could maybe put up a guide explaining invading and bingoing in detail so I could get the hang of it I'd like to try though.</p>

						 <p>Now that we're in the War, I need a little bit of help with some resource management.</p> <p>I need 2 to 3 Jonin (or Sannin I guess) who are willing to be SWATBU Captains. More specifically, I need people who can invade Villages when I'm currently bingo'd. Perhaps even more important, Uzuki's getting close to looping, and I'm going to need capable Ninja who can handle the wars when I'm not going to be able to.</p> <p>The requirements are as follows.</p> <ol> <li>Must play regularly.</li> <li>Must be a Jonin (full Jonin, not Special Jonin).</li> <li>Must be confident in their abilities to be able to successfully invade Villages. (<a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/items:codec">Codec</a> is a plus!)</li> <li>Must check the forums often enough to notice when I've requested an Invasion within 24 hours. (once a day is fine)</li> <li>Must be willing to help out with putting spies into other Villages</li> </ol> <p>The benefits?</p> <ol> <li>You get a cool title! I'll put an SWATBU section in the announcements with your name.</li> <li>You'll be set with permissions to attack other Villages (though this should generally not be used, as the money isn't great and it eats up a spy).</li> </ol> <p>Once you become an SWATBU Captain you remain an SWATBU Captain until you cannot fulfill the requirements anymore (either you loop, or you simply can't play enough, or you do something you shouldn't).</p> <p>Do we have anyone interested?</p>
