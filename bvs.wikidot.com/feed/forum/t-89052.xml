						 <p>every day it repeats the following, adjusted for day and for season:<br /> this is also all you see for the first 14 days.<br /> " Level Cap! Your character is currently in Season 1. As such, you may have a maximum of 20 in any one stat. Once you hit that, this message appears. A Special Mission has opened up, allowing you to reach a whole new level of play. Good luck! (You have a few days from hitting the cap to start a new season before your Stamina is cut. In 14 days, you will no longer be able to level up, Spy, Attack, or Bingo until you loop, and the Writers may start cutting the budget (Stamina and Stamina Bonuses) of your show! Number of days so far - 26)"</p>
