						 <p>For those wanting maxed Bits, Chosen - Despaired - Touchstone, would likely be the best place to get them at bare minimum. Lvl210 Field, and you get the +1500Bit virus (Last Warrior) showing up. On the downside, prepare for a ton of useless encounter rolls.</p>

						 <p><a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/fields">http://bvs.wikidot.com/fields</a> is where u can look through for info, but in shot way:</p> <p>U can look for 2 possibilities:<br /> 1. Diff 155 for virus Blank Variable best chance, at first for newbies and those who also wanna a bit of core, not only bits. My researchers proove that it is good and possible way. U just had bad luck/little tries/etc.<br /> 2. Diff 210-220 for Last Warrior virus for&#8230; vice versa: well upgraded/trained players that wanna MOSTLY bits<br /> 3.for r00ty bigginers also exist the lowest diff lvl with Silver Rat and events only but I think when people asking about bit farming they are higher in bvs-hacking way :)</p>

						 <p>I only had 380 app when I started on essences, even still I managed to do two a day by using Cici and Lulu's -10 app cost bonus. Never underestimate that team. But like Rika said, eat ramen and buy apertifs from the juice bar. A lot of the later content of the game is just a grind to get through it, and r00t isn't even the biggest grind, so I've heard.</p>

						 <p>1) Are you Legacy? 2) Have you got all the +app perms? 50 comes from Cipher, but with a lot of other stuff as a non-legacy I have 440. That said, with 320 and a Cookware you can get two 40 app. ramen, which makes it 400 app and able to eat two. Or eat one ramen and 8 apertifs. Either way, it either takes a long time or a lot of money or a lot of shared effort on the behalf of a village for one person. Sorry, but this is the slow grindfest that endgame becomes solo.</p>

						 <p>Two a day, at crippled stamina, which would take the better part of two months in total… just to save 80k a day… no good, they'd be better off strapping in and using their tacos to grind 100k+ a day. Which of course is nonsense so I highly recommend avoiding both. As you say the best thing would be to borrow them or, ideally, gather them slowly in preparation. It's not always easy to find allies when you're new but I think it's important that they should know what NOT to do, and that's drinking them with their appetite…</p>

						 <p>It is when you buy a single one of each and spend your app on two a day. Yes, it does take time, but it;s doable. And much better than just begging for them. That said, a lot of villages have standing stockpiles of them, from villagers taking their one freebie daily even when they don't do Root stuff anymore and storing it in the storehouse. Fish around, see if anyone would be willing to take you in and let you borrow some of their essences or something. Anything but begging,</p>

						 <p>Yeah, the discords and demons are like that. They're abnormally difficult for where you are, at the point you encounter them. Post-discord, it's much easier for a good while. And the demon checks, for the keys for the 11-tailed fox, are some of the most difficult there are. I didn't do too much recompiling, and have about, maybe, 80 levels per stat, with a good deal of range, and I'm hitting 90+% on most non-key checks.</p>

						 <p>Tomorrow when I have stamina I'll go back into the Fields and find the exact fields name. It has the least amount of viruses that also contains the Last Warrior, which is why it's so effective. And it's not a "changes daily" thing, it's always in that range.</p>

						 <p>Well, in some cases, no. Especially around 150-159 diff, you can get blank variables with 750 bits, plus viruses that give 750 core. If you go up one difficulty, and breach 160 difficulty, or even 170, additional 42/29 virus encounters are added, that give the same 750 core, meaning that you get bits that little bit less often (more potential encounters with same sample size) Overall, higher difficulty does equal higher profit for *individual* actions, but the number of potential encounters matters as well. I went for 150-159 difficulty on a full sci4 day with core ability, overture, and stalkergirl3 (so each action was 1 stamina), and made plenty of bits for all the way to the 11TR, plus plenty for field dances later on, not to mention over a million core. I'd say that until you can get the 1500+ core ones easy, that's your sweet spot.</p>

						 <p>Hi, I've been watching this discussion from the constant emails I've been getting &lt;_&lt; &gt;_&gt; Yes the stated field is way too low diff, I just went and checked. But that's not the point, both of you know where to find the right fields, and personally I believe there's no point naming one since everyone seems to agree they change daily. I would estimate that you can hope for about a million bits on a good day's stamina of 1stam actions, and the core level will be in the millions. From one day. More core than you could ever need for current content.<br /> But, we're all judging this by tiny sample sizes so I'd rather we shoudn't get all statistical! MIKOLA, this alternate bit source theory is interesting, and it would make a good explanation for why the higher difficulties have so far seemed useless, but until someone shows me a comparably profitable day from there, I'm not sure what else I can say to you.</p>

						 <p>Yes, and since this requires stalkergirl level 3, it means you must have visited Beautiful Passed Over Touchstone with 6 Lost Weapons, which will also get you the last field key there: Paradise. From here you can visit fields of "difficulty" ~215, where you will find Last Warriors for base 1,500 bits base per regular encounter. Therefore if you wait for a day when Science4 fully activates, you can finally do a "Bit grinding" day: turning the cost per action down to 1stamina, hunting for high bit fields (don't hunt for core, trust us, you will get millions while searching for the bits), and then once you've found one you like, running mega actions for an expected value of up to around a million bits, from a single day's work.</p>

						 <p>If your village is tiny and you keep getting damages, seriously considering switching villages is a good idea. Look for a moderately-healthy village that's actively recruiting in the 30+ member range. Those tend to be the most likely to succeed, while also needing the most people to succeed. All in all, you would be welcomed in them.</p>

						 <p>Ah, that would be because the village size is too small, and he's "not recruiting" for whatever reason, but that's not my business… well those damages can be paid for very easily with a tiny amount of village ryo, so it's not as big as problem as the game makes it seem. But if you want to move, that's your call. Just make sure you pick a bigger village or it'll be the same problem :P</p>

						 <p>Bit shop is standard prices. If you mean recompiling, then the cost for increasing a stat is 500 for a level, 5k for strength, 1k for range, and 7k for success. Then each successive increase for that stat/attribute is twice the base more. So, the second level is 1500, then 2500, etc, str is 15k, then 25k, etc. Note that if your village has the Hex Editor kaiju upgrade, then you get a 10% discount off of that.</p>

						 <p>There is a formula but it's pretty basic from what I remember. Honestly once you get the Discords done and can farm above that, especially once you have MegaActions available, you earn so much that you don't really pay attention to how much you have or need anymore, because you just simply have it. It's one of my major issues with R00t, honestly; it's so hard to get core prior to Discords, when you need it to pass them, yet after, when you have access to Phases, you start to not need ludicrous stats, and can stat up only a little off your initial statting from the Discords to deal with the Demons.</p>

						 <p>My first advice would be Get the hell out of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Dodge</span> Season 7- Seasons 5-9 are pretty much dead water for r00t, because of the ratio between Death Chance and Base Drain. Hopefully you're in the middle of speedlooping. Secondly, you want to grind up some levels- do it quickly and with focus, it shouldn't take more than a few days once you get to Jonin in the right season. Don't aim for level cap, but at least 30's will be quick, easy, and helpful with the discords. Make sure you have some good perms- forget about monster drops, but Mono and Wasteland completion as many times as necessary with Top Gear is pretty much essential. Make sure to complete (most) of mono in the season you are attempting it, it has a few non looping stat perms, and the reaper blood will be invaluable. There are various non-plot non-kai bonuses- halloween perms, Arena perms, Golden Items, Party House perms (mainly prize wheel as far as I remember), and Shop Perms. Don't forget to buy Counterfeit Permit from the shop again as it doesn't loop.<br /> Hopefully a r00t candidate would have most of these (I think you probably do), so level grinding would be a good choice (again, don't waste time going too high), since it will last for as long as you stay in that season, but I'm just writing these things down to supplement the guide with a little more detail for those who want it.<br /> It is my personal opinion that kai drops should be only a last resort for discord hopefuls, unless they lack Polar Star and/or Regalia. These two are very useful and will be needed for r00t progress anyway, so it's not too silly to try and buy them at a good price.</p>

						 <p>the discords are (currently) my biggest problem. The perms are easier to get with a little time.</p>

						 <p>That, and in addition to the higher base drain, later seasons offer higher stat caps, which means it's easier to get around those nasty 35/40 checks for the discords, and the 50/50 and all later on, with less recompiling. And he's right, the right perms can be very useful. Boomstick for strength, Pink Taser and Pink Skull for help with focusing, and the K-Belt and Time Reversal Cube to dodge, should they actually hit you.</p>

				<title>Recommended Season: S10+</title>

						 <p>Nobody in their right mind says S4, the people who do it in S4 have special reasons- they don't do it because it's sensible. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">minimum</span> "recommended" season would rightly be S10, as jimwormmaster later said. As anyone could tell you, "the higher the better", but going above S20 before you've finished r00t is <em>probably</em> wasting your time.<br /> S10, although sooner, has a significantly lower Base Drain than 15 or 20, and although there are a lot of other sources of drain… considering the fact that +7 drain in juice costs around 100k PHRyo per day, and of course a chunk out of your juice limit, a few extra days of quality speedlooping can save you a lot in r00t. For this reason I would personally recommend somewhere around S15, but the right perms ('goodbye kitten' pink taser for example) can make a world of difference. At the end of the day, you should pick a season you like, as you're going to be in it for a while.</p>

						 <p>That depends. Some say S4, as the max push death chance is lower. Though I prefer around S10…Yes, the max push death chance is higher, but with the detective duo team, you can get around 700% of normal damage, which can make fighting phases a bit easier…but that's been a long-standing debate.</p>

						 <p>And if you're too early to have Cursed (haven't beaten all 3 discords), but you've gotten at least one discord key, one HFHG key, and one of the two aa-rank keys, which are possible to get after a single discord (for example, raging forbidden dance floor), you can get that magic 110 difficulty as well.</p>
