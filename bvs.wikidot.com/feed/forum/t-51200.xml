						 <p>Although, it may not be all that important to even use that anymore. Assuming that the #1 player yesterday used Obsessive Insight on every mission, he'd still have gotten more than the next two players. So if anyone can do what he did, just without the jutsu, he/she may be able to hit the top three anway.</p> <p>Of course, it's going to be hard to predict what people will do differently now that the top three players can be promoted to Sannin.</p> <p>I'm not seeing why there should be waves. The first wave is obvious, and will probably last for about two weeks (at least thats my guess, it'll definitely be worth watching to see), but I don't see why there should be any more waves.</p> <p>Also, a quick question that I've been wondering, when it says you have to be <strong>today's</strong> number one player (now top three), does it actually mean <strong>yesterday's</strong> number one player (/top three), just displayed on the day that you take the mission? Or do you have to take the mission on the day you try to hit the number one (/top three) spot in a sort of leap of faith that you'll actually succeed in becoming number one (/top three)?</p>

						 <p>@ Fax- I'm aware of all those as well. I suppose that I don't know exactly how many people would use such techniques to hang out with anonymous for the sole purpose of hitting top 3 (or #1 if they want the theme for that), but it seems unlikely to me that both of the people hanging out with Anonymous are doing it to hit top 3, as well as multiple people using other tricks.</p> <p>Also, as Uzuki said, the other ones come at a cost. It might not even be worth it. Though you could partially side-step the ryo penalty by purchasing a bunch of items, and then selling them the next day. You'd lose half your ryo, but that's better than all of it.</p> <p>Basically what I meant to say is that, while before hanging out with Anonymous was practically a necessity, now it can be reasonably done without him.</p> <p>—-</p> <p>Also, the fact that more people will be able to achieve Sannin rank means that more people will be taken out of the Jonin pool. Since Sannin don't count in terms of the top players, and even if they did, they have little incentive to hit top 3 (aside from the theme you get for being #1), then after a while, there may be less competition to get top 3.</p> <p>Or perhaps not… but logically, it makes sense.</p>

						 <p>Actually, the Hanging Out bit is incorrect.

						 <p>Well, now you only need to be top 3 to get Sannin, which makes it a HELL of a lot easier. Yesterday's top player was at around 1.76 million XP (which means 1.9 million XP from the party house should just about solidify your status as top player), but the third was only at a little more than 1 million XP. Also, considering that only 2 players can hang out with Anonymous in one day (exclusing the mysterious power), there's almost guaranteed to be at least one player achieving top 3 WITHOUT hanging out with Anonymous.</p> <p>Given, the competition will probably rise to the new challenge (more people will set their sites on it), but if things remain how they are, getting top 3 should be fairly easy with the right planning.</p>

						 <p>All out bashes only give 100,000 (or sometimes 50,000), not 1 million. You could win the 1 million ryo prize from the prize wheel, buy 19 parties, and only end up with 1.9m daily XP, which wouldn't be enough to make you #1 (but it'd be a hell of a start!) (by Uzuki - i don't know how to quote^^):</p> <p>if you win the 1 mio ryo, and a bash is 10k, you'd be able to buy 100 partys would't you? thats 50-100k Xp each thus giving you 5-10 million xp… i'd feel pretty compfortable about beeing #1 then. ;) … but spending all that money seems pretty worthless… but anyway what would you do with all that dough?</p>

						 <p>You get a bunch of daily XP. It's the same for both season 2 and season 1. The 'best' way to do it is to get a <em>ton</em> of stamina on one day and hang out with anonymous. Do as many A-Rank missions as you can while using the jutsu that gives +50% XP, and stack that with as many other +XP bonuses as you can find.</p>
