						 <p>A wandering Chunin, seemingly lost, wandered right into the proximity of the cantina. Well, into the wall, more likely. Peeling himself from the brick, he wandered into the actual entrance with a cheesy monster mask on his face. "When did this bar get here?", he wondered aloud as he sat at the bar itself, watching the commotion unfold before him.</p>

					<![CDATA[
						 <p>A light haired jonin entered the town, his black cloak mixing himself in with the darkness fluttered in the breeze. Eyes sharp from his life of battling to survive caught sight of a newspaper article floating in the wind near him. Reaching out, he flicked a chakra string towards it and pulled it to him. SNAKEMAN was all he needed to read before deciding to go the cantina. Reaching behind him, he placed the newspaper article in a pocket next to a scroll that held all of his puppets. "Should probably get a move on if I want to get anything to drink." Pulling his hood over his head, he started towards the direction of the cantina.</p>

The footsteps of other ninja.</p> <p><em>"Something you want to tell me?"</em> asked the rider.
