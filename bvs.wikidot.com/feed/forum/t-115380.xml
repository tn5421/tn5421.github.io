						 <p>I've only got a couple of days left before my Stamina starts getting cut, and I don't think I've been doing very well in preparation for a Sannin run thus far. However, I'm going to make my shot at it, and was wondering if there were any villages with an Epic Monument/Juice Bar [Without it, I don't have much of a shot] who wouldn't mind allowing a Sannin Runner in temporarily.</p> <p>I really don't have much time, and I'm probably going to leave my village within the next couple of days just to have enough time to get into a different village before my times up. o_O</p> <p>So thanks in advance!</p>
