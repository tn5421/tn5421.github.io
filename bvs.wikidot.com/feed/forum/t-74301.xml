						 <p>Of course I cant let everyone know what our actual village particulars are, as that would be like giving a bank robber the keys to the safe lol!</p> <p>Anyone wishing to join however is of course more than welcome, were always friendly. I myself am usually lingering around in the village ready to help however I can and answer general questions.</p> <p>If you do decide to join our Village, please state in the box that SimonSan referred you, this way we can confirm how you got to our village.</p> <p>Thanks, SimonSan</p>
