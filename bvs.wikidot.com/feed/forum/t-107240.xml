						 <p>Well, I got 4 Thankyou potions in total even though I didn't vote the correct President (I wrote BvS survey though) and wrote many bugreports about it.</p> <p>And, in one case, there's a "Bad Password" error and there I have to write in a "Bug Report", however, I noticed something in that page. It was that they would give 3 potions or more as compensation for certain cases. I think the word "potions" referred to Thankyou potions and that's how I got my potions. Any thoughts, guy?</p> <p>Another thing is that although this BvS states that the "Blizzard Jutsu" is different from "Exploding Tags: Activate. They produced the same effect "+3 Nin Levels" when I tried it 25 days ago or so..? I wonder if there's a bug or error. &gt;.&lt;</p> <p>See ya soon!~ :)</p>
