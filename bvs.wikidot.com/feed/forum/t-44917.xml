						 <p>So I think I can work a "recent posts" link to the top of each page, but it's going to have to wait until a little bit later for me to really play with the formatting of it all. I'm not going to have the time in case I break something. Perhaps later tonight or tomorrow.</p>

						 <p>Yea, that recent posts button was really really nice. I didn't feel all that "smooshed" by the sidebar before. The only real question now is, is the smooshing worth that lovely button :P</p>

						 <p>The only thing that kind of bothers me at the moment is that there's no easy way to get a "Recent posts" button without the sidebar when you're in the forum section. I could move it to the top bar, but I want to keep that from getting too cluttered too. Otherwise, yeah, it's just a matter of clicking the logo in the upper left, and you've got full navigation again.</p>

						 <p>I was just about to ask about that sidebar. I'm not actually sure what I think so far. The sidebar was useful but it's not like it's hard to get back to it just by clicking a button at the top of the screen.</p>

						 <p>I was starting to feel like the forum was a bitâ€¦smooshed. I think the problem was that the theme we were using had a sidebar that really compressed the main reading area. The side bar is good for the Wiki, less so for the forum I think. So I modified the CSS setup for the forum and this should give us more breathing room.</p> <p>As always, if people preferred it the old way, I can always switch it back.</p>
