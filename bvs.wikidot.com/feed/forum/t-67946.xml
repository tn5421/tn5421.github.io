						 <p>Sorry for this post, I just can't help myself.<br /> 1) Uzuki isn't the only one underlining that "hangin out" allows justu use in REGULAR mission. Not anymore.<br /> 2) This my friend</p> <blockquote> <p>(Also no offense, but just because you are online does not mean you need to throw out your intellect for the sake of getting a question asked. Good spelling and punctuation go along way. So try a bit harder to type out your words and such. Shorthand is fine, but not so good when you need help. Most people prefer to not have to pull out the "Websters Noob Dictionary" to figure out what was asked. Just trying to help from one person that used to type that way to another that still does.)</p> </blockquote> <p>is EPIC! and I'll say no more</p> <p>Edited for clarity*</p>

						 <p>I'll translate.</p> <blockquote> <p>if some1 can tell me what 4 it is ?<br /> tq</p> </blockquote> <p>That in English is,</p> <blockquote> <p>Can someone tell me what friend points are for?<br /> tq</p> </blockquote> <p>Now the answer: They are a way for you to be able to "Hang Out" with your friends and use their jutsu free in "REGULAR" missions and learn them at half the cost.</p> <p>(Also no offense, but just because you are online does not mean you need to throw out your intellect for the sake of getting a question asked.
