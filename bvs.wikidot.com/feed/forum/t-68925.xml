						 <p>I've noticed that every now and then, pages get created improperlyâ€¦then, instead of renaming the page, a new page is created instead.</p> <p>I just went through the list of orphaned pages, and made a list below of pages that are due to be removed because there are proper pages for each subject as well. However, I was wondering if there might be an easier way to report pages like these in the future, perhaps placing a "delete" or "deleteme" tag on the page, so one of the people with deletion permissions can easily find pages like these and decide if they actually warrant deletion.</p> <p>There are also a number of player pages with little to no information, unupdated in months, and some which aren't even listed on the Players page, which should also be considered for deletion. How should those be approached?</p> <p>Pages which should be deleted:<br /> <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/banana-sticker">banana sticker</a> ( page name does not begin with 'items:' and was recreated )<br /> <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/small-pearl">small pearl</a> ( page name does not begin with 'items:' and was recreated )<br /> <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/upgrade:lab-coats">lab coats</a> ( page name begins with 'upgrade:' instead of 'items:' and was recreated )<br /> <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/mission:whitsand-the-eye">whitsand the eye</a><br /> <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/mission:wander-the-sands-nin">wander the sands nin</a><br /> <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/mission:wander-the-sands-gen">wander the sands gen</a><br /> <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/mission:wander-the-sands">wander the sands</a><br /> <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/mission:robogirl-and-tic-tac-have-a-sneaky-plan">robogirl and tic tac have a sneaky plan</a><br /> <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/jutsu:dance-of-the-cresent-moon">dance of the cresent moon</a><br /> <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/items:ceramic-plate">ceramic plate</a></p>
