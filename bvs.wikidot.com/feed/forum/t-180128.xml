						 <p>Can someone add that the emblem doesn't count for perm count for now?</p> <p>Also, it should be corrected. You don't have 11% at getting the emblem from the event (which should be noted as 11DBHK Meetup), but you get a perk from the meetup that on activating, you have an 11% chance at getting an emblem. The difference matters, since a perk can be used once a day and you may have more than one at a given moment, and that sometimes the event is during a main event, when the prizes are doubled, so people won't think they have 22% chance of getting the emblem, but will get two 11% perks.</p>
