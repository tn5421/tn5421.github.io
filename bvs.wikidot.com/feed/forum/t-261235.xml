						 <p>While looking up <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The First Loser</span> trophy(under 10Points tab) in the Trophy section on this wiki,<br /> I noticed you have "Get Second Place in The First Loser" as the requirement for this trophy. This isn't correct.<br /> The requirement to get this trophy is to be a consolation prize winner or basically the first NON-winner. (2nd Place is NOT the first NON-winner)</p> <p>(since there is a range of winners depending on the amount who entered, the consolation prize winner is never the 2nd highest bid{would require a VERY LOW # of players}.)<br /> (to further instill the idea that 2nd Place is NOT the first NON-winner, someone who bids the 2nd highest bid gets a message saying "You've Placed 2nd in First Loser")<br /> (another thing to notice is that the consolation prize winner will have a bid by their name that either EQUALS{in case of a tie} or is LOWER than the lowest bidding winner)</p>
