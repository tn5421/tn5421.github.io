		<description>Posts in the discussion thread &quot;goal to get item in League of Legends named after Billy Vs. Snakeman&quot; - In League of Legends the reward for getting 1000 referrals is naming an in-game content item. I want to name an item in honor of BvS.</description>

						 <p>First off here is the link for my referral page.</p> <p><a href="http://signup.leagueoflegends.com/?ref=4db02e22c11a4251158774">http://signup.leagueoflegends.com/?ref=4db02e22c11a4251158774</a></p> <p>Its a free to play game that is fun whether or not you want to help with the item naming, all you have to do for the referral to count is reach lvl 5, which is not very hard.</p> <p>When I reach 1000 referrals I will name an item after whatever the most voted BvS item is that appears in this thread.</p> <p>I want to do this as a thank you to McMasters for making BvS, and as a way to further promote his game. I love playing this as much as LoL and hope that others will be able to enjoy both games as much as I do.</p> <p>I will also update everyone periodically on the progress of this endeavor.</p> <p>Thank you, and wish me luck.</p>
