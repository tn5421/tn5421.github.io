						 <p>Be sure to brush your teeth so your breath does not smell bad, wear cologne and keep trying to get the mission. Spending the ryo on the wheel will just eat up all your ryo. Eventually Terri will be attracted to you.</p>

						 <p>I seem to be having a little trouble getting Terri as an ally…<br /> Every man and his dog knows how to get Terri as an ally - you just completing 'Ride Your Ninja Kite', the C-Rank Tai mission (<a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/mission:ride-your-ninja-kite">http://bvs.wikidot.com/mission:ride-your-ninja-kite</a>).</p> <p>This all sounds well and good in theory, but 700+ Stam later spent on Tai missions, ~400 of which was using the Red/Spot team, ~100 just using whatever team I had at the time, and the rest just using a random +tai lvl group I threw together to give me a total of lvl 23 tai and +3 str just to make sure I obliterated all the missions…</p> <p>Today I spent 200 stam on tai missions. I only got the terri mission twice (completed with 16 &amp; 21 successes). Other days I've had the mission up to 10 times, successful every time - still no terri.</p> <p>Why do I want Terri, you ask? To level up lil'sammy, of course…<br /> Why not use the party wheel? I did.. that's where I got ALL BUT ONE PHOTO.<br /> I've so far spent another 30k on the wheel trying to get the last photo, but no luck &gt;.&lt;</p> <p>I know I tend to have this affect on women some of the time, but srsly :-/</p> <p>So - ideas?</p>
