						 <p>This discussion is actually really funny for me to find now, since I'm being a S1 completionist and got him level three with a bit of effort.</p> <p>I used Palmface, Rayne, Sticky level 2, and Princess Slug. I don't remember how many perms I had when I did it, but I've got 200 right now.</p>

						 <p>Doing some calculations of my own, with every possible item from the Perm Items Tabbed section that gives bonuses excluding PW and non-tradable Lost Weapons, using a team of Doughman3, Flutie 2, and whichever is the 8 lvl/rng for gen ally (I don't use them much, forgive me) that an S3 can obtain a maximum total level (bonus + base) of 86 levels, resulting in a required range of 59, which in the end, subtracting the 14 range from the allies and the 5 range from Amanda (summon), is 40. All +gen range perms give a total of 46. If you use Cobra Kai instead of Bankai, it's still completely possible to do, as the total levels drops by 9 to 77, which results in an end result of 46 range required, at which point you'd have 50 range. It's completely possible to do in S3, but no sooner due to season locked content. It'd be the absolutely most difficult thing you'll ever do… And it'd be entirely a waste of time beyond all shadow of a doubt…. But it'd be possible in S3.</p>

						 <p>Basically, If you have 100 nin levels and 50 nin Range, you'll get 5000 (using "TFOM"). The less levels you have, the more range you'll need.<br /> Divide 5000 by your levels in order to get the amount of range you'd need in to reach 5000 and Whitey level 3</p>

						 <p>So, in order to get the minimum 5,000 rolls, what would your minimum stats have to be? (This is using "This Fist of Mine" from Pinky 3, so as to ensure you're going to get the exact amount that you can possibly get and thus, get exactly 5,000 (or even better, OVER 5,000! (aka 5,001).)</p>

						 <p>Based on my limited calculations, you can do it as an S4, but you'll need nearly every obtainable stat booster short of Lost Weapons.</p>

						 <p>It's worth noting that the minimum Season at which you can acquire him is currently unknown. It was thought to be S8 for a while, but I've done it at S7, and frostwing claims to have done it at S6. Given this, S5 SHOULD theoretically be possible, but after that I start to have doubts.</p>

						 <p>As I said in the other post, it is 5000 damage FROM YOUR ROLLS ALONE. Doing the 100 swings doesn't help, using a storm favor to give you 50% damage doesn't help.<br /> If you're only season 3 there is no way you can get the levels and range to do 5000 damage just on your rolls alone.</p>

					<![CDATA[
						 <p>the requirement is for you to deal 5000 damage in your rolls alone (your range * your Levels) before all the adjustments. Say you had 50 range and 98 levels, you could not get Lil whitey level 3 as that would mean the highest roll you could achieve is 4900.</p> <p>Also he does NOT have to be in your team</p>

						 <p>Is the requirement to get more then 5k of damage in one attack?</p> <p>Also, does Lil' Whitey Lvl. 2 need to be in your team when you do it?</p>

					<![CDATA[
						 <p>It is sort of incorrect though. You are implying that someone would need a certain amount of range and levels, but that isn't true. They just need to get a high enough range. It was determined that all that is needed is to get a certain percent of your max damage, which is determined by your max range multiplied by your levels and successes added together. So if you had a range of ten, two succeses, and three levels, then your max base damage would be 50. ((2+3)*10)</p>

						 <p>not really. If you have Pinky 3, use her jutsu and you automatically get the amount needed to level whitey.<br /> EDUT: see my comment on the bottom of Whitey 3 page.</p>

						 <p>It seems that level three is tough much like the others are. Where pinky needs a lot of luck, so does whitey. Just for different reasons. It seems that you just need a good amount of RNG love for whitey to hit that percentage of your max damage.</p>

						 <p>I have the Lil'whitey lvl2 and all my rolls are with 4 digits. But I simply can't get the lvl 3. I tried normally, with him on team but nothing. I tried almost 10 right now. Something that was supposed to be easy.</p>

						 <p>Alot of Damage, seems to refer to % of max damage I believe I did well over 800k damage on my 121x hit ( but didn't get ally), but when I got Whitey 3 I did 5000+ on my basic roll ( I forgot exact amount) my average was 4057 or so based on stats so I think the trigger might be to do 75-90+% of max damage possible (my max was 6077 based on stats), I also had whitey 2 at the time so that may also be a requirement.</p>
