						 <p>From the ashes of SRCC village spawns Tsuki Village - The Village Hidden in the Moonlight!</p> <p>Now we are not the newest Immortal Realm to be spawned in the game, but we indeed are rising to great power in a short time. Currently we can offer a great community of villagers(41 total) so we are gaining tons of ryo daily and a good amount of upgrades. We are approaching 60 upgrades and now enticing kaijus. Currently we are at the Celeste kaiju and we are offering the drops using a ticket system so everyone has a fair chance at getting a drop. We can supply you with BurgerNinja, an Immortal Realm(+30 stam), Tools of the Trade, and about +50 stamina per day. Soon we will be going Epic as well which will make Sannin available. If you want, you can join up with us and have some fun while we build our wonderful village from the ground once again :)</p>
