						 <p>Well, it's like this. I know what boring bulbs do. I've used them when I had to and moved on. Their function hasn't changed in the slightest since they were introduced, so why would I go to the boring bulb page and see that the format had changed?</p>

						 <p>So, I've been bouncing around various pages now, and I've noticed that a lot of the item pages now have a new picture block that seems to be a replica of the in-game "click to show small window stats" thing. A lot of them are uncomplete. It's not just me, right? They are new? Or have people just been really lazy and haven't been filling them out? Or is it that no one really knows how to fill them out (I'm guessing the latter, myself).</p>
