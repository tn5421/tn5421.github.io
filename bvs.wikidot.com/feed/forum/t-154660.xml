						 <p>Thought I'd help out our village leader advertise a bit since he wants more people. We are a small-ish village that has gone downhill since betanos/alphanos (one person) quit a while ago, and the village leader thing was new to him. Since many people have quit, we need some more people to help us out.</p>
