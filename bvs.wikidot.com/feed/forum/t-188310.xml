						 <p>Yeah, figured it wasn't doable at Special Jonin. I'm only in the low 30s in level. :P</p> <p>Guess I'll switch villages to one that has a Juice Bar. The one I'm in doesn't have much of anything except inactive players. Thanks for all the tips, guys.</p>

						 <p>Wastelands is doable at Season 1. Difficult and frustrating, but doable. Unfortunately Ro-Sham-Bo (2) doesn't work in Wastelands. The only allies that work in wastelands that you don't get from Wastelands are Haus, SNAKEMAN, Haro, Larry, and Proof Reader. Minion for Life (Haus+SNAKEMAN) is probably your best initial Wastelands team in Season 1. You will want to be at least Jonin (for the extra range) before seriously trying Wastelands.</p> <p>It's expensive, but you can use Chasers (Juice Bar) to increase drop rate. However, I don't think Shammy 2 is required for anything but Ro-Sham-Bo 2.</p>

						 <p>RNGs _do_ hate me, but I'm on about 60 missions with her now and no luck. That's pretty ridiculous. D:</p> <p>No good Ally Drop boosters for a season 1 Special Jonin, then? SBYN is a season 2 theme according to the Wikidot, and I Need This is part of the Wasteland missions, which from what I've seen on the wiki don't look particularly doable without either the Ro'Sham'Bo-2 team (which is what I'm _trying_ to get) or some permanent items I shouldn't have yet.</p>

						 <p>Her drop rate isn't very high, and if you don't use anything to boost it (Stand By Your Ninja theme, I Need This jutsu), you're leaving yourself wide open to RNG hate.</p>

						 <p>I'm trying to get Shammy to level 2. Since the prize wheel isn't giving me any Terri pictures (though it loves feeding me Bags of Chips), I've taken her on missions in hopes of getting her ally drops. I don't think it's natural to do 45 successful missions in a row with her in my party and not get a single picture, is it? Am I somehow doing something wrong? v_V</p>
