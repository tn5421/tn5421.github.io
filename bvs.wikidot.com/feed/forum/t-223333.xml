						 <blockquote> <p>now as i figure it the lowest stats to achieve a roll of 5000 is lvl 71 range 71 without %boosts like Pinky's +30% and so forth.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is far easier to get levels than range. You're more likely to get lvl 100 range 50 than 71-71.</p> <blockquote> <p>so I think I'm pretty sure I got this wrong, since that would make him way too hard to get.</p> </blockquote> <p>No. You're right so far.</p> <blockquote> <p>I tried using this fist of mine while having with a Nin of about lvl 45 range 35, can't remember the exact numbers right now, and swinging 100 times.(x121 damage)(does that boost count?)</p> </blockquote> <p>No it does not. You can get lil' Whitey on a single swing. One thing you might be missing: lil' Whitey 2.</p> <p>All you can really do is give your self as much range and levels in your team as you can. Boosts to Range and Levels count (just not boosts directly to Worldkai damage). Shift around your reaper blood. And if all else fails, loop to a higher season or do other content until you can do this. This is high end content. It's not meant to be easy.</p>
