						 <p>True, but people tend to mind chatspeak more than bad grammar. There are excuses for bad grammar or bad spelling (if you don't live an English-speaking country or the USoA), but if someone wants to ask a question, they really should at least type their words out properly. And some of us don't lurk in forums/chatrooms where chatspeak is often used, so abbreviations do make it harder for us to understand their posts.</p>

						 <p>He's using both, actually, and the abbreviations he's using are pretty standard. There's nothing odd about them:</p> <p>ur = your<br /> lv = level<br /> 4 = for<br /> succ = success</p> <p>That's pretty obvious. It's the fact that his grammar is bad that makes it difficult to read. I mean, if I wrote it like this:</p> <p>"why dont ur allies lv up after a succ on a mission??" (there's no place that I can put a "4" and still make it grammatically correct)</p> <p>That's not diffiicult at all. It's the broken English that's making it difficult to read, not the "chatspeak," if you will.</p> <hr /> <p>Lol, sorry, can't do that. The only reason I can look up his IP is because he never registered. Really, I think it's pretty stupid to go around posting your IP everywhere, but that's his choice, I guess.</p>

						 <p>Lear, he's using abbreviations, not broken English. That has nothing to do with good English-speaking skills. He's just too lazy to type out his words.</p> <p>Also, try looking up my IP. =P</p>

						 <p>Allies who level up through normal missions must be on your team when you do the appropriate mission.</p> <p>Allies who level up through special missions <em>usually</em> don't have to be on your team when you do the mission. The only exception to this so far are some of the Wasteland allies: they all share the same level-up mission, but only the people on your team will level each time you take it.</p>

						 <p>All the more so, then … if it's an effort to write English, I'd expect to see somebody take the effort to find the right word. This looks like pure texting shorthand…</p>

						 <p>Now, now, while I agree with you two in most situations, you also have to realize that not everyone on the internet comes from the US, Canada, Britain, and Australia. Believe it or not, the internet exists even in far off places like South America, Africa, and Asia. You can't expect everyone to speak with perfect English because quite frankly, not everyone who uses the internet knows perfect English. If I visited a Spanish site and tried to post there, I would certainly hope that the members would be forgiving of my less than perfect Spanish.</p> <p>Now, if you would have taken the time to look actually look up this persons IP and check where he/she is from, rather than just jumping on him/her, you'd know that this particular person is from Indonesia, and probably writes in English only with great effort.</p> <p>So please, before you just go randomly attacking someone on their English skills, be sure that the person you're attacking is someone who ought to know better.</p>

						 <p>I'll try and translate this…….I may fail.</p> <blockquote> <p>why does my allies not level up after beating the mission four (4) times? :(</p> </blockquote> <p>Now I believe that is the correct translation? I may be wrong.</p> <p>It is a game of chance, if your lucky your ally will level on the mission after you pass it if not then keep trying. There is a percentage (%), but I do not know it.</p> <p>My Personal Signature.</p> <blockquote> <p>(Also no offense, but just because you are online does not mean you need to throw out your intellect for the sake of getting a question asked. Good spelling and punctuation go along way. So try a bit harder to type out your words and such. Shorthand is fine, but not so good when you need help. Most people prefer to not have to pull out the "Websters Noob Dictionary" to figure out what was asked. Just trying to help from one person that used to type that way to another that still does.)</p> </blockquote>
