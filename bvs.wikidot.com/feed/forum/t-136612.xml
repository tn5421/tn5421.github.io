						 <p>Engi Village is a few days away from being IM-ready. The only things I still need areâ€¦<br /> 1) Three more kaiju upgrades (two more after today; we're enticing as fast as we can to get through this part)<br /> 2) Fifty villagers.</p> <p>The first part will go by quickly, even if we hit some of the 20k HP kaiju; despite being a village that's a bit less than only five months old, we've raised it from scratch to near-IM status and can dish out ~10k kaiju damage a day. The second part is where you can send a character on over to get a Survived the Impossible to make your Wasteland Trips a bit easier, while snagging an extra crank level and more daily stamina.</p> <p>Applications will be accepted as soon as I see them :)</p> <p>UPDATE: We're at 40 villagers now, only ~10 more to go.<br /> UPDATE2: 45 villagers, almost there!<br /> <strong>UPDATE3: THE IM IS UNDERWAY</strong></p>
