						 <p>Well Ananvil replied first about a 100 shuriken trade. If he can do that in the next, say, 2 days, then the stealth suit is his. If not, Schon can have it for the chakra armour.</p> <p>I'll place the stealth suit in the storehouse now. So it'll be there for whomever can trade.</p> <p>Just don't let anyone else take it, Uzuki.</p>

						 <p>I'd figured that those two couldn't be traded, but I wasn't sure. Ah wellâ€¦ I'll remove them from the list then.</p> <p>Actually, I like Uzuki's system better. I'd rather him distribute items fairly, rather than giving it to whomever has the most valuble stuff to give in return.</p> <p>Anyway, like I said, I'll hold onto it, so even if it takes you a while, once someone gets an item they can and want to trade, just let me know.</p> <p>Also note that, should I happen to get any of the items on the list, they'll be removed from said list.</p>

						 <p>As a general rule, my intention is to take any monster drops I can trade and give them to whoever had the largest number of attacks on the kaiju if they didn't get the item already. I believe that using the monster drops to encourage village development is probably more important than my getting more permanent items :)</p>

						 <p>Uzuki, you could summon a monster we've already fought and trade the monster drop to Lear for a Stealth Suit.</p>

						 <p>Referral items and the hollow leg can't be traded (it's impossible to get more than 1 of them). Wish I had something I could trade though, Stealth Suit is one of the items that I'm not rockin yet :(</p>

						 <p>Alright, long story made short, I got EXTREMELY lucky today playing the prize wheel. In my first two plays, I hit the grand prize TWICE, winning two stealth suits.<br /> Since permanent items don't stack, I'm left with an effectively useless item, so that gives me three choices:</p> <p>1.) Trade it to someone else for, ideally, an item that is equally rare and/or powerful.</p> <p>2.) Be a nice guy, and just donate it to the village.</p> <p>3.) Be a not-so-nice guy and sell it for my own profit.</p> <p>I won't be doing number two. I'm nice, but not that nice, and I'm pretty much broke too, so the ryo from selling it is a nice incentive for number three. However, I'd hate to see such a rare item be used for the sole purpose of fattening my wallet, which is why I'm here.</p> <p>If anyone is at all interested, and has any item that I would like, I'll offer a trade. I suppose this is similar to the "extra codec" thread that appeared a while back, but I'm not as nice of a guy as he was.</p> <p>So anyway, my offer. I'm willing to trade my extra stealth suit for any of the following (though whether a trade would be beneficial from the other end is debatable on some of these):</p> <p>Codec<br /> Love Love Paradise<br /> Any monster kill item<br /> Sevens Trophy*<br /> Any item that I could sell for 12,500 ryo or more.</p> <p>*I don't even know if it's possible to drop these in the storehouse and thus trade, but if they are, then I'll take them in a trade.</p> <p>Anyway, even if I don't get any response to this, I doubt I'll sell it. It's too rare of an item to do that, so even if no one wants to/can trade for another month or so, I'll probably still have the item. Just let me know if you're interested because otherwise, all I've got is dead weight.</p>
