						 <p>Note rush once you get to The note level of the trade gives +20% ryo and xp (including ranking xp). You can also help out your allies in another village by bingoing them with a notepage to get them Anonymous. There are also some Wastelands allies who give you additional benefits when you bingo with them in your party (most important is probably Palmface who gives you +50 Appetite) When Pizza witch opens up, there are certain cards that can only be bought with Style (which you get from bingos). Finally you can do a bunch of bingos in a village to let someone in the village use a storm favor to unbingo everyone and get a Ninpo Mask.</p>
