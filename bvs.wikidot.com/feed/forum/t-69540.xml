						 <p>Are there any Bingo'd village leaders in the crowd who could take an about to loop Jonin (ninja name: Jackalope) for a bit? I'm not running missions for a bit while I gear up for a Sanin run, so I'm good in a Kaiju fight and patrolling and all that. I want to try out the Wastelands while I'm waiting, and kind of need a Bingo'd leader right now.</p> <p>I'd only be in until I loop/as long as you need me, but eventually I want to go back to my original village because I have friends there.</p>
