						 <p>I did a wiki search for "Puzzles" and I got the page "Hooray for Puzzles!", which was the inaccurate one. A lot of people would go straight for the specific search, not look at the Missions page.</p> <p>OH! I didn't mean that the Professor questions were correct, I meant that those were the ones still listed as the current puzzles. I meant that I updated the info to the most recent puzzles.</p>

						 <p>…That's because you were looking at the wrong page. How did you get to that page without going through the updated one first?</p> <p>The up to date one is the one on the Missions page.</p>

						 <p>The bat puzzle. The puzzles stop at the chicken/wolf river crossing. The wiki says the stamina given is 50 for every puzzle though. Unfortunately, I don't have the patience to calculate the solution to the bat puzzle.</p> <p>EDIT:</p> <p>Okay, wow…all of the puzzles from the Professor Layton series were replaced with new puzzles, except for puzzle 7, which was just heavily edited. I've completely updated the puzzles info (Which was quite a lot actually) except for the answer to the final one. Should I add myself to the contributors list, or…?</p>

						 <p>While I thought that the stamina bonus was wrong, I had already completed the puzzles, so I couldn't test it for myself. If the stamina bonus isn't 20 for the puzzles ( other than the bat puzzle ), then go ahead and update it.</p> <p>Which puzzle do you say is missing though?</p>

						 <p>I was checking the wiki for information about the Puzzle Corner and found that the stamina prize for finishing a puzzle is incorrect and there is a puzzle missing from the list. Should I update the information?</p>
