						 <p>The change to Officer's Pay was so McMasters could possibly add other ways to obtain extra NWW fights in addition to Yoma Bloods - it was a preemptive change to avoid future problems. That and the change to Fun Club Memberships due to what Uzuki said were completely independent of each other, they just happened to be changed at the same time(or close to it)</p>

						 <p>but… now, you can't get 100 nww fights, can you? because yoma blood costs ap.</p> <p>Anyway… you would need loads of ryo for that much yoma blood. It costs 450 for a ticket, and blood gets you 4 fights; assuming you won them all, and got 1200, you'd still have to get yoma blood on 1 in 3 regular scratch cards to make a profit that way… and that's just rediculous.</p>

						 <p>The infinite ryo bug wasn't related to the scratch off cards. The issue was that the Slot machine was designed to pay out 97% of what you put into it before Fan Club Memberships. Thus, with Fan Club Membership, the pay out from the slot machine was actually _higher_ than what you put into it on average. Because of this, some people had setup a script to play the slot machine constantly (24 hours a day, constantly).</p> <p>The NWW nerf had to do with people getting 100+ NWW fights from the scratchy game.</p>

						 <p>Wouldn't this have been limited by simply adding Appetite to the Yoma Blood? I'm saddened by my loss of income.</p>

						 <p>In theory, if you were extremely lucky and had Officer's Pay, you could win enough Yomi Blood to gain Ryo from your NWW fights. You could then use that profit to buy more Yomi Blood and repeat infinitely, or until your luck ran out.</p> <p>Personally I don't see what the big deal was. Yes you could gain ryo for a short while maybe, but eventually (and probably sooner rather than later), the law of averages would bite you in the ass and your streak would end.</p>
