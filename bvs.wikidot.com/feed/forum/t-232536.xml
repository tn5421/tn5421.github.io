						 <p>There are two places in the game where it's possible to &quot;pull Ramen&quot;. I can confirm that she affects the Ramen pull in the village menu, and have seen no evidence so far to suggest she has any affect on Ramen finding or usage in Zombja maps. Possibly the page would benefit from a clarifying note about what her ability does.</p>

						 <p>Mr.Tea lvl. 3has a trivia comment stating "This is currently the only Lvl. 3 character without a Lvl. 2 state.",<br /> I think it should be noted that Sue lvl 2 is the only lvl 2character without a lvl 1 state. That's just what I think.</p>

						 <p>Her name is probably "Sue" because Momo has an adorable speech impediment that causes her to end most of her sentences with ~su. Which would also account for the strange way she talks in BvS, adding "s" to many of the words in her sentences :3</p>

						 <p>After watching all of Saki yesterday and today I can confirm and update this. I don't get why it is Sue though, perhaps based also on someone from Akagi? I'm watching that next so I'll update if so.</p>

						 <p>This character appears to be Momoko T≈çyoko (stealth momo) from the anime series saki. In the show momo is able to hide her discard tiles and is known for being able to go into 'stealth' mode in order to do so. This would also explain the joke about her being with you the whole time, as due to her initial inability to control stealth mode her classmates and teachers never really realized she was there in the room.</p>
