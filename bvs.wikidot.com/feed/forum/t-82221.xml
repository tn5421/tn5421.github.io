						 <p>Im in Kamkatana village. Are NRF is reenabled which sucks. I think the village size for it should be alot higher. But anyway.. I was just trying to figure out if anyone knew if a upgrade was disabled due to membership size if it still shows up as being able to be raidable as if it was never disabled. Its nice not to have monster attacks but still being able to be raided by villages with an NRF sucks.</p> <p>Thanks again.</p>

						 <p>Not sure where to ask this but I guesss this is a good place as any since its NWW related. If you have upgrades that are disabled, do they count against other villages or you attacking/raiding other villages?</p> <p>What I'm specifically trying to figure out is this. My village has the Natural Resource Facility. It is currently diabled to due to membership levels. So we can't use it- which is kind of nice at this point really but that's another story- Do we show up as having a NRF and being able to be attacked? We seem to have been attacked/raided alot lately so I am guessing this is true. If it's disabled can I lead an attack on a village with no NRF?</p> <p>Thanks for your help.</p>
