						 <p>well note that i count a total of 730 awesome on the wiki. however i know Lafiel has 770 awesome. meaning that the wiki isn't complete. and some players like Lafiel don't modify the wiki to help others. Lafiel who is top player (#1) has 247 perms, 770 awesome, and is season 60 as of billy dayroll on 04-22-2010.</p> <p>I know that the <strong>Rising Sun</strong> trophy isn't listed. (20 awesome is what i heard) then that would mean 20 awesome is missing from here. i don't know where the extra 20 is, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was something along the lines of summon a lv.3 enraged WorldKaiju and defeat it.</p>

						 <p>Perm count is a tie-breaker when determining rankings. I suppose it's conceivable that McM could add a quest or something similar that requires you to have a 200+ Perm Count, but if he has no one's found it yet.</p>

						 <p>there are several perms out there that don't count towards perm count. then there's items that add more like snugly teddy bear or the seasons collections.</p> <p>is there any benefit to a higher perm count or is it just for bragging?</p>
