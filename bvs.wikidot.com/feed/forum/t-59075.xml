						 <p>Hrmm sorry to double post but just thought I'd update again real quick.</p> <p>Tried to bingo a different village leader this time, season 1 this time so no theme to mess with, and within a few hours of the dayroll.</p> <p>Still wasn't able to use a note page on them, the whole "Village is helping them too much" (on the first round).</p> <p>Guess this is just some bonus for being the leader, everyone charges to your defense right away?</p> <p>Anyway, if anyone knows for certain please let me know, otherwise this is just info for folks who end up searching for it like I did.</p>

						 <p>Ah, if it helps the error message was something along the lines of "You don't have time to write their name because their village is helping them." So I wasn't sure if that was a bonus for being the Kage or something like a theme.</p> <p>Thanks folks, appreciate the help! Guess I'll try again today if I can get some glowing goo.</p>

						 <p>Greetings Folks,</p> <p>Seems like you got a nice community here and I'm trying to find a piece of information that I can't recall if I read some where before or not.</p> <p>Recently tried to get The Trade done after a failed attempt yesterday, got myself 5 more apples and went to bingo a village leader with my handy note page and couldn't!</p> <p>Did I just pick a target who is a bit too strong or can you never use a note page on village leaders? Does a Season 1 SP. Jounin (tai) with 15/14/15 levels stand any chance at scoring a bingo against a village leader?</p> <p>Any advice would be appreciated before I run off and get myself bingo'd yet again by attempting this.</p> <p>Thanks ahead of time.</p>
