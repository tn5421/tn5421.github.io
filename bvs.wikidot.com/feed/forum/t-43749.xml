						 <p>I thought everyone might like to know just how successful the site's been considering that it's only been around for a month.</p> <p>For the last three days or so, we've been getting 800 visitors <em>per day</em>. On average, they're spending about 10-15 minutes on the site, and visiting greater than 20 pages a piece.</p> <p>Considering I first setup the site around Feb. 6th or so, having 800 people a day in that short amount of time is nothing short of amazing. I take that to mean that there really was a need for something like this Wiki, and it really wouldn't have been possible without all the help you guys have provided the site.</p> <p>Excellent work! I really hope we can keep it up!</p>
