						 <p>How simple do you need them to be? There are already guides for those reachable from the drop-down menu that appears when you hover the cursor over the "Guides" on the navigation bar at the top ( just below the "Search" function ). The Monochrome Guide is just missing the parts on getting a full moon in the Dark Hours of the Arena and completing the Tsukuyomi Ascendant special mission, and the Wasteland Guide doesn't list the order to mix ingredients for the gear you have to make, but other than that they are complete.</p> <p>Monochrome is only for Season 2+ ninja, so until you've finished the first Season, you won't be able to access that content.</p> <p>Alsoâ€¦Uzuki is not the only person to help you with this stuff, others of us can help out too. Even if you specify his name in the topic title, unless it's something only he can help you with, then other people are going to come along and answer your questions anyways. I would suggest making the topic title pertain more to the subject you're addressing in the topic, rather than asking for only a specific person's help. Something like "Newbie Guide for Reaper, etc.?" or even "Could I get a dummy's guide for these?" may have been more appropriate.</p>
