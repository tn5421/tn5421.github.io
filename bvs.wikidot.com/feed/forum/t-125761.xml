						 <p>Basically, I have terrible luck with the whell so I only win it when it is village ryo or a +200 stam and as a result still need the prizes from it. I was able to negotiate a second necklace which I will offer anyone who has obtained an extra kdog's headband.</p> <p>If anyone has an additional Codec as well, tell me what you are looking for and I will see what I have but the necklace is my only thing of any real value as far as I can tell.</p>
