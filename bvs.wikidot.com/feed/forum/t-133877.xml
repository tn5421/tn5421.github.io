						 <p>Sure, if you go to www.userscripts.org, and search for "BvS", you can find all sorts of useful scripts for the game, including the aforementioned scratchies one, some useful scripts for r00t content, and billycon stuff. If you don't have greasemonkey, it should be at the get more extensions page for firefox (not sure about chrome, I think it works there, too)</p>

						 <p>The link above leads to the text-only version. Pretty much, you enter it in text form. For example, if you know the first four spaces are 2 blanks, a letter, and a billy, you'd enter —LB. L for letter of marque, B for Billy, P for Super Potion (the red one) and I believe S for the blue potion (a Sho Nuff). Though I tend to use the greasemonkey script :D</p>

						 <p>I've used the script with legacy and redeye, and I went for claymores as legacy, SNE's as redeye. Latest version, always, I update it whenever it's out of date. Went for the spots with the highest chance, according to the script. Most of the time, if it said that spots A, B, and C were the ones with the highest chance for that 4th blue potion/billy, spot D was the right one, and A, B, and C were all something else…</p>

						 <p>What's your bloodline and strategy? Did you update it recently?</p> <p>Anyway, sometimes it's just bad luck. It's not like the script can guarantee you a sure win every ticket. It just tries to give you the best chances there is out of it's database. I once won nothing and then at around the 50th ticket I got 72 buckets. Don't expect instant wins, but you have higher chances with the script…</p>

						 <p>Weird, I was using the V4, and I had absolutely horrible luck. In 49 tickets, I've won 2 super potions, and 3 yoma blood. Yeah…like 2 wins out of 49 tickets…I'd hardly call that "working perfectly" o_O Maybe I'm just doin' it wrong.</p>

						 <p>The scratchy tool V4 works perfectly as long as you are S2+ and select your strategy. I won a SNE on my first day of scratchies after 50k invested and I get other stuff from it every day, buckets and other junk.</p>

						 <p>Considering that the "random spots" on Scratchies may have a meaning. Can the same be said about Red Eye revealed spots?<br /> Esaxe 21:42&nbsp;9/13<br /> Yes.<br /> (from the BC Q&amp;A)</p> <p>After that I send in the question if those "random" spots are bound to the cards -&gt; BillyClub Question Denied : Your question was denied. REASON:</p> <p>Well I think that might be exactly it, might be time to add those "random" spots and the other bloodline input to the scretchies, if they are realy bound to a card that might up our chances there a lot.</p>

					<![CDATA[
						 <p>Related link:<br /> <a href="http://bokekage-reports.spoonybards.net/tools/skratchy/">http://bokekage-reports.spoonybards.net/tools/skratchy/</a></p> <blockquote> <p>McMasters has already said that the cards are not truly random: although the number of cards the game can use is very large, it is finite. It's also well-mixed, so that as long as you look over the entire set, a given spot is no more likely to contain any particular picture than any other spot.</p> <p>But because there's a finite number of cards, the above only holds as long as you're looking over the entire set of cards. The more you can narrow down your search, the more the randomness breaks down, and patterns start to emerge. The skratchy database is designed to aid in this: tell it about a card, and it will show you all the cards it knows about that match the one you gave it. This is the most basic use of the database: tell it what you know about the database, find the patterns to make your next scratch, and then repeat the process with what you know now.</p> <p>Now, as to how to use the database:<br /> A card is just a string of at least 25 characters: one per spot (you can also use whitespace, which doesn't count as spots but can make the query a lot easier to read). The spots go left to right, then top to bottom. There are nine characters you can use:</p> <ul> <li>B: Billy</li> <li>L: Letter of Marque</li> <li>P: Potion</li> <li>S: Sho' Nuff Elixir (for historical reasons you can also use R here)</li> <li>1: Bonus x1</li> <li>2: Bonus x2</li> <li>3: Bonus x3</li> <li>-: (a spot that has not yet been scratched)</li> </ul> <p>That's it. Most people put spaces after spots 6, 14, and 20, which are the breaks between rows on the card.</p> <p>Now, to really put it to use, what you'd do is the following:</p> <ul> <li>Buy a SuperTicket. Note the spots your bloodline reveals.</li> <li>Enter what you know about the card -currently just the bloodline-spots- into the database. You'll probably want to click the 'Show card pictures' button to convert the text into images: the reason I start as text is that doing so makes the page show much, much faster.</li> <li>Find what you want in the cards, and find where it appears most often. If it shows up in one particular spot in all of the cards, then it is very likely to be there on your card too (it's possible that you might have a card the DB hasn't seen, but this gets less likely as we get more cards).</li> <li>Scratch a spot on your card, other than your bloodline-spot (if you plan to scratch that spot at all, always scratch it last).</li> <li>If you scratched something other than your bloodline, then you now know more about the card than before. Put this into the database to narrow your search even further.</li> <li>Repeat the process until you've scratched off the whole card.</li> </ul> <p>But the database is getting too large to be practical without additional tools. Finding patterns is not all that difficult when the database can show you 10 or even 20 cards. But when it shows you hundreds, that's too much. I need to write new tools on top of it, which can analyze search results and get back to the user on what they need to know.</p> <p>The hell of it is, the tools are already written, but as Python scripts: I used them to build the database initially, and they've been good for my own testing and analysis, but if I port them to JavaScript and add them to the DB page itself, they would be useful for a lot more people. What I need is the time to do that, and I haven't been lucky in getting that recently.</p> </blockquote>
