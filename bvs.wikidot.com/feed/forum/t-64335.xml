						 <p>Well you can also stack a lot of ryo and experience.You can then use the ryo on the 10,000+ ryo parties which will get you lots.Then you can buy Ramen.If memory serves,one of the Ramen actually gives to your overall ranking for the day.Added in with the experience from the missions and if you have the Aura of experience should make it too easy for you.</p>

						 <p>Basically what most people do is stack a team with as many XP bonuses as possible and do as many missions as possible. A team of pandabear, timmy level 2 and pinky level 2 or stalkergirl(any level) for the stamina bonus. Then use obsessive insight on B-rank mission. If you can not run B-ranks without help then substitute emo level 2 for pinky(stalkergirl) and do nin. specific B-rank missions. All of that should do it, but i have also heard of someone who spied there way into jonin. There are various ways to get the XP so do not be scared of being creative. This is just a basic idea but if you want more detail refer to this <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/guide:xp">XP guide</a>.</p>
