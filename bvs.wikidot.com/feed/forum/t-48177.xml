						 <p>upload the pic yourself though do not take the link from the site. We want to keep as independent as possible.</p> <p>I am replacing as many pics with uploads as I can if I miss one plz fix it.</p> <p>Just download the pic then go to the bottom of the screen and click on "files" then "upload new file" browse for the file and upload it. Do this in the article that you want the pic in. Next you want to edit the article and delete the code that had the other picture and add your own code. The easiest way is to use the insert image wizard.</p> <p>Hope this is enough.</p>

						 <p>Added pics/descriptions to a lot of items, at least all the ones I have access to. If you've got rares, drops, or monster items, please check to see if it's got an image and description, and add it up.</p>
