						 <p>Does Mister Tea secretly actually have a Level 2 form, and is it secretly even MORE awesome than his Level 3?<br /> Buretsu 14:14&nbsp;9/22/10<br /> McM: Mister Tea's Lvl. 2 is already in the game. Note that I chose my words very carefully.</p> <p>Is 'Reaper's Game' the same as the plot wherin Mister Tea tries to take over the Wasteland?<br /> Halar Ebon 20:00&nbsp;2/17/10<br /> McM: No, but Mister Tea is involved.</p> <p>So it seems that he's trying to say that Mister Tea's Level 2 is his Level 3. Thus he might be the first we witness having a Level 4, or could be an alternate like Cipher is. Either way, I remember SOMEWHERE (Maybe forums?) that McM stated that HQ was a Flashback, or something like that, and thus we might see his Level 2 in HQ. That's the only reason for the vague "something we see in Hero's Quest, or something like that" I wrote above.</p>

						 <p>lol this is like the biggest mystery ever to me, if i had enough money for BillyClub that would totally be the question i'd ask. also, wouldnt it make more sense if Tea2 DIDNT have anything to do with HQ since he seems to have been in game for quite a while? i noticed that the notes said he existed quite a while ago. although i dont have access to McM or anything, so if you happen to know for sure its HQ stuff then i believe you</p>
