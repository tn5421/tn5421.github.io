						 <p>A wandering Chunin, seemingly lost, wandered right into the proximity of the cantina. Well, into the wall, more likely. Peeling himself from the brick, he wandered into the actual entrance with a cheesy monster mask on his face. "When did this bar get here?", he wondered aloud as he sat at the bar itself, watching the commotion unfold before him.</p>

					<![CDATA[
						 <p>A light haired jonin entered the town, his black cloak mixing himself in with the darkness fluttered in the breeze. Eyes sharp from his life of battling to survive caught sight of a newspaper article floating in the wind near him. Reaching out, he flicked a chakra string towards it and pulled it to him. SNAKEMAN was all he needed to read before deciding to go the cantina. Reaching behind him, he placed the newspaper article in a pocket next to a scroll that held all of his puppets. "Should probably get a move on if I want to get anything to drink." Pulling his hood over his head, he started towards the direction of the cantina.</p>

						 <p>As RazyVan walks in and sees he is met with peering eyes,all looking at his scratch-less headband,one in particular arises.He stands up,squints his eyes and laughs.</p> <p>the man in the fedora only looks over his shoulder peering at the newcomer!</p> <p><em>"So,who the hell do you think you are???!"</em><br /> <em><strong>"Me"?</strong></em><br /> The newcomer looks up at the peeing eyes,as everyone is startled to see his strange yellow eyes,inhabited only by a strange black mark<br /> <em>"Who else do you think I'd be talking to,dumbass?"-</em>Shouted the man,over-flowing with anxiety and will to fight!<br /> the newcomer simply took a letter out,looked at it,raised his head and answered-<em><strong>"Do you know what this is?"</strong></em><br /> <em>"huh?why would I,it won't make a difference!!hahahah!"</em><br /> <em><strong>"It is the green light of face-beating!"</strong></em>-and the man turned thte letter so it was read-able by all in front of him.It simply said,"Beat Face",and was accompanied by a signature.<br /> <em><strong>"what do you think you are going to do with that,huh?"</strong></em></p> <p>The man in the fedora looked at it,his eyes growing large with astonishment."A NWW higher officer?"</p> <p>The newcomer rolled it back into his sleeve,looked at the man in front of him and opened his palm's,thrusting them forwards with his fingers sticking out,then,suddenly two puppets came up through the floor in an instant,both sending their poisoned arms through his chest in an instant.As he withdrew them,he looked up,and as he gripped his sword and drew it out one centimeter,he shouted-<em><strong>"Awaken,Zangetsu"</strong></em><sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-692998-1" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" >1</a></sup> and the sword burst into some kind of Lightning chakra,everyone was on the ground.Everyone in the bar was dead,except for one,the man in the fedora,who looked up staring at the floor,then at the sword which was now completely changed.It was like a long pole,on each end it went off into a sort of Z-shaped blade,which went into opposite directions on each end.One faced down,and one up.Lightning,real lightning was streaming through it and the strange energy flowing out.</p> <div class="footnotes-footer"> <div class="title">Footnotes</div> <div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-692998-1"><a href="javascript:;" >1</a>. name is the same but the effects are completely different</div> </div>

						 <p>The man in the fedora looks up from his kbar, sees some guy walk in with the chakra seeming to pour off of him, and snorts, going back to his knife. "Guy's gonna get himself killed walking into a bar that's known for serving missing-nin lit up like a freaking raiton jutsu with chakra," he mutters to himself.</p>

						 <p>As a young ninja with a strange coat with an insignia in it noting something about reapers who seems to be under the effects of some kind of sickness walks up to the cantina,he notices the strange amount of chakra flowing from it and decides to check it out.As he moves with greatness under his coat he looks up into the night moon,his headband gleaming with the sign of Hinamizawa on it under the moonlight,and as he entered the cantina is shined under the lamp-light,dozens of heads peered over their shoulders to see what happened,all of them missing-nin!</p>

						 <p><em>…It burns….</em></p> <p>BBB felt tears spring to his eyes the moment the Hatake Howler touched his tongue. He couldn't spit and he couldn't swallow. It was as if the toxic mix had rendered him incapable of doing anything other than feel the painful stinging. <em>….Must swallow…</em> he told himself. <em>…Must make pain go away…</em></p> <p>By the time he had mustered up the strength to force the noxious drink down his throat, the girl Cana had already gone and had been replaced by a strange man who was giving the bartender the stink-eye. When the bartender finished serving the other nin, BBB raised his hand politely, getting ready to order another drink.</p> <p>"Whassamatter? You ain't finished yer drink, yet," the bartender commented. "Dontcha like it?"</p> <p>Intimidated by the burlier man, BBB immediately shook his head. "It's a perfectly good drink, sir," he blurted out. "Just a bit strong for my taste."</p> <p>The bartender spat. "I ain't dishing out the next one til you finish that, boy."</p> <p>Sighing, BBB went back to the Howler. Maybe if he took little sips this time…..</p>

						 <p>Dresden glanced at Cana as she leaves then orders another round of vodka and starts downing them. Dresden pulls his sleeve up as the bartender glances at Dresden's arm and notices the cuts on them. The bartender looks into Dresden's eyes and starts to ask a question, but Dresden looks into the man's eyes with a look of pure killing intent so the bartender stopped his question and grabbed more glasses of vodka. <strong>"Yep all is fine and dandy…."</strong></p>

						 <p>Dresden sat back causally and watched it all unfold, he drew out sabrial just to make sure no one wished to mess with him, just as he finished drawing it a Kunai flew through the air aimed right at his head, but within half of an eye blink his sword was deflecting the kunai back at the thrower. <strong>"Yep this is going to be fun…"</strong> Dresden remarked as he watched cana fighting. He wondered if he should help, but decided against it, <strong>"You can handle yourself kid….."</strong> Dresden then glances at the bar keep and back at the carnage. <strong>"Yep…..im not paying for this either."</strong> Dresden said while flashing sabrial a bit.</p>

						 <p>"Gomen, I must've fallen asleep for a bit…" Skip shrugged off her fatigue and looked with dismay at Dresden who had just rang the bell.<br /> "This sucks…I'm not getting paid for this crap! Plus, now I have to enroll in a new village and whatnot…looping's looming as well. Cana, I think I need something stronger-" Her foot went out to trip the nin sidling too close for comfort, a hand just too close to his weapon. Stamping on his throat she waited emotionlessly until the struggling stopped and the last breaths left the figure.<br /> Cana looked to her and the body, a little shocked at Skip's out of character brutality.<br /> "Can I have that drink now?"</p>

						 <p>Dresden sips some more and wonders how stupid they must look chatting it up in a bar where fighting and such should be going on, but Dresden prefers it like this. <strong>"Yeah you'll live or you can just give up and go back to Lone Wolf or what ever it is you wish."</strong></p>

						 <p>Dresden sighs as he takes another sip of his drink, <strong>"Agh the jonin exams what a blast…..I planned on doing them tomorrow but sadly that plan is gone out the window since I have yet to get all the stuff together and I still require the crazy love triangle, ive got one of them down 2 to go. I gues I will use the 21 day bonus and the 1 week bonus tomorrow and hope I get everything I need together for the next go around."</strong></p>
