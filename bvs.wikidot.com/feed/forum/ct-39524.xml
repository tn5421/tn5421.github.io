						 <p>Hi there!</p> <p><strong>Rail Village</strong> is currently about 20 ninjas away from our goal of exploding.</p> <p>We have daily kaiju! We are fighting <strong>major kaiju</strong> now. We have <strong>zombjas.</strong> We have <strong>free stuff</strong> for newcomers. I've been giving out RP when I get the chance.</p> <p>Yes, we can bingo people now.</p> <p>Remember, you don't have to be active to help an Impossible Mission village. You can be idle and still reap the rewards!</p> <p>Come join us!</p>

						 <p>We now have 22 Ninja in our Immortal Realm after gaining some new ones, 142 upgrades including BurgerNinja, PizzaWitch, Temple of the Four Winds (Mahjong), Enticement Altar, Epic Monument and our new Elemental Beacon.</p> <p>We're summoning most days and spare drops are handed out to villagers based on number of attacks though as we're just starting to summon the Major Kaiju there are no spares from them. We run regular medium Zombja maps with draws to select who launch the nuke or closes the gate. When we get the people to go through hard maps quickly enough we'll switch to that.</p> <p>Anyone that wants access to these upgrades as well as a friendly and active village with plenty of random chatter in the message board is very welcome to join.</p>

						 <p>Ok, I am not the village leader, but the actual leader seems to not be getting many people to blow up this village, and it's been happening for 4 months now. We need about 30 more people as everyone seems to be tired of waiting, so if you want to help out, get as many people as you can. We still fight kaiju during this period as well so you can get yourself some sweet item drops too.</p>
