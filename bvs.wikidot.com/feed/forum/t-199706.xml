						 <p>Ok, since some things are apparently being overlooked (and/or ignored if they were unclear).</p> <p>1st: Probability<br /> Probability for the first day obvious requires that the number to win must be 10880 or higher (11001-121 = 10880).<br /> No surprise.</p> <p>2nd: "Day" here might be someone misleading. This is assuming that someone wins each day, and/or that the number of entries is until the next person wins. That is, "day" here refers to the same game.</p> <p>3rd: The probability calculated is based upon winning at least once. So "day 1" = 11 entries (121), thus 121/11000 = 0.011 (No surprise). From this, we have the probability of not winning day 1, which is 1-0.011 or 0.989.</p> <p>However, day 2 is calculated by 1 - Not winning day 2 Given not winning day 1.<br /> Thus 1 - (0.989 * 0.989) = 1 - (0.989^2) = 0.021879 = 2.1879% which rounds up on the table. Keep in mind, this is assuming a new game each day in this case.</p> <p>Day 3's probability (3rd game, and not on the same day as game 1 and game 2) = 1 - (Probability not winnning game 3 * prob not winning game 2 * prob not winning game 1) = 1 - (0.989^3) = 1 - 0.967361669 = 0.032638331 = 3.2638331&nbsp;%. Which after rounding comes to 3.26%</p> <p>Same thing for 22 entries per day (which means 22 entries are purchased on the same day, and ONLY those 22 entries in 1 game, no new game during those entries).</p>

						 <p>very true, last time i looked i didn't really look since i as tired. i suggest either be updated with the proper formula (i could do it on spreadsheet, but not sure how here) or it needs to be taken down.</p> <p>EDIT: I was bored so i made what i think to be a decent attempt at a statistical chart on google docs. if there's anything wrong, let me know via pm of something. (you won't be able to edit anyways)<br /> <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AmmgO-LRG3OUdEZhMzR5dENlb0JELXQ1U3lvQjdpZGc&amp;hl=en">http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AmmgO-LRG3OUdEZhMzR5dENlb0JELXQ1U3lvQjdpZGc&amp;hl=en</a></p>

						 <p>I'd recommend this page be deleted as the current numbers are completely off.</p> <p>FYI.</p> <p>121/11000 is your chance the first day.</p> <p>Assuming the winner doesn't change your chance when you play the 2nd day is 242/11000 for a true chance or 121/10989 for a probability on that push alone.</p> <p>when winner changes your chance all starts over.</p> <p>many factors are missing from these very wrong Calculations and this game is by far not determined in a manner that using any of this system would really matter.</p> <p>There fore I'd hope this page gets removed.</p>
