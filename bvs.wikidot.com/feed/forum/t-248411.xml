						 <p>There is honestly very little you can do to increase your odds of passing. That's just a consequence of a 10/1 difficulty in rides, as there is neither strength, range, successes, or edge and additional levels barely increase your odds of passing. Just make sure you're going at the correct speed and possibly upgrade your jacket (your primary determiner of Drivetrain) to be able to afford a few -30 Drivetrain penalties.</p> <p>Just remember that there is no real penalty for failing other than your spent ride and possibly some spend PW cards. You may have to do this ride several times to pass, but you will eventually.</p>

						 <p>well your speed needs to be set to 1 for a chance to pass it. if you can't pass it right now, you have a few choices:<br /> - upgrade your gear<br /> - save tips for a better ride<br /> - use a different equipment and D-Abilities</p>
