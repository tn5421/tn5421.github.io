						 <p>UGH!!!! I was just about to post when I realized I wasn't logged in, so I logged in and it deleted all the stuff I typed…<br /> Anyway…</p> <p>I still don't like the training sashes. I know that it's harder to get a bloodline power now, but seeing someone in the arena with three total matches and a power really peeves me… Especially when I would've won the match normally, and instead I tie or lose. Today I won 1 match out of 4, and 3 of the matches were beginners with powers.</p> <p>I was brainstorming earlier, and I think it would be nice if the sash <em>instead</em> of being auto-given to every Sp. Jonin and above, be obtained by doing one of these:</p> <p>A) Have them be able to be bought/gained from a village upgrade.<br /> B) Have them a rare/uncommon from the prizewheel.<br /> C) Have them gained by winning 5+ matches in one day in the arena<br /> D) Buy them using reputation points (probably 500-1000)<br /> E) Nerf them, and make them lesser powers (RedEye switches to a tie if you loose and has 2 uses, WhiteEye only has one use, and Legacy… hmm… Not too sure how to nerf Legacy…)</p> <p>I personally like C and D (D the most) since you actually have to show an interest in the arena. Maybe even have everyone auto-get E, and then have it upgraded by either C or D.</p> <p>There, I kinda like that. :)</p>

						 <p>Uh…. there really isn't any way to "play it perfectly." Certainly, there are some ways to play that are better than others, but there is even a strategy in playing poorly. It catches your opponent off guard.</p> <p>By now, I don't do that much anymore, but I used to. I've got my system down to an algorithm, that I hope is good enough that no one will figure it out.</p> <p>Also, I should point out, that sometimes a very good move looks like a poor one if you're not thinking in your opponents logic. It's a game of chances. You could think, "My opponent will probably throw Nin here, so I should throw Tai" OR you could think, "My opponent will probably throw Nin, but if I use Gen and he uses Tai, then I'm almost certain to win, while if he beat my Gen with a Nin, I'v still got a decent chance."</p> <p>And Lokumun, while the Training Sashes do seem unfair to those of us with a bloodline power or two, think of the newbies. By now, a large number of people have at least 1 bloodline power, and some even have 2 or 3. That'd make it MUCH more difficult for the newbies now to win their bloodline power than it was for the older players. And it's only going to get harder.</p> <p>Quite frankly, the training sash was a good idea. It would eventually become necessary; might as well add it now.</p>

						 <p>AAARRGH!!!! I HATE the training sashes… A LOT!!! I worked <em>so</em> hard for my eye of the tiger, and now any Special Jonin, no matter how noobly they are, are <em>instantly</em> able to match me. TT~TT It's so frustrating… so now, my win percentage, along with rep points for the duelist's aura will drop unnecesarily… against a noob who happens to have a training sash… Ugh…</p> <p>Bah! I think they're a little unfair… I barely go against anyone without a power anymore… Not to mention it makes anyone who wants to earn one for real's life <em>much</em> harder… I wouldn't mind petitioning for their removal…</p> <p>And another thing about the arena… Now that the original +10 bonus to your opponet's win rate for Reputation points is gone, and with the Dark Hour bonus, no one ever plays in the arena outside of the dark hours… Even <em>less</em> then there was originally… Ugh… stupid arena…</p>

						 <p>Whether anti-coagulant is worth it is a fairly complex math problem. You need to calculate your chances of winning when you can come up against anything, and compare that to your win rate when you face people with zero powers. Then figure out on average how many games you should expect to do in both, and calculate the ryo cost for both (adding 4k for each match if you're using Anti-Coagulant). It may be cheaper (though still expensive as all hell).</p>

						 <p>@BvS-Uzuki: the Anti-Coagulant costs … uhm … too much for 10-15 fights =/<br /> but i gues the bonus is worth it (if you look at the +1 / +2range and the +15% Daily XP items, and there are probably coming even more great arena items)</p>

						 <p>All rants? doesnt say BVS only rants……<br /> The earth is spinning, the world is dying, everything around me is frying, my hopes and</p> <p>dreams are long gone, dead with the May night that fell so long…….I watched and</p> <p>waited, cried and whimpered. Of all these things I wonder was it worth it? Was the pain,</p> <p>the sadness, the sorrow worth all of this that may happen tomorrow? If I die will you cry?</p> <p>If I die will I fry? I had my hope, my faith in you and you chewed it up and spit it out,</p> <p>like it was worthless. I cared for you, I prayed for you, hell I'd even gone through hell</p> <p>and back just for you, just to prove I'd be there in the end, just to prove I was a</p> <p>friend. I'd always come back, I'd always return, I kept my word, I proved it right, I'd</p> <p>stand by your side at the end of time. I'd be the one to help you through it, but then you</p> <p>go and ruin it all over something stupid was it worth it? Was it? Was it worth it to know</p> <p>it might end, to know that it may never begin again? What if this is the last of my words?</p> <p>What if it is the last of my cords, what if this is the true end that I have always been</p> <p>looking for, but was always saved by a friend? Where is that friend when you need them</p> <p>now? Where is the friend I loved and cherished, where is the friend I poured my heart out</p> <p>to? The friend is gone long, long gone, I cared for you and now your gone. So as this</p> <p>comes to an end I turn to my friend the only one thats beside me its stainless steel</p> <p>barrel is a godsend. In the end this is my only friend and it will be with me at the end.</p> <p>As I hug it tight and kiss it goodnight I pull the trigger and say good bye forever.</p>
