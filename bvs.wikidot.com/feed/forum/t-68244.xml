						 <p>From where the wiki currently ends:</p> <p>Success! You rock out amongst the piles of corpses his solo creates!</p> <p>Bones and Emo rock out, and afterwards, Bones doesn't want to leave! "FIND ME SOMETHING BRUTAL," he says, drooling blood and gore. Yeek.</p> <p>Bones joins you!</p> <p>Oh, and Three out of Four Bonus seems to be any combination of the four sound ninja, as I currently have the bonus with Flutie, The Twins and Tubby, all lvl2.</p> <p>Double oh, new mission just now, probably unlocked with Bones:</p> <p>Ninjutsu<br /> Wander the Sands<br /> You trek deep into the Outskirts, as day turns to night..<br /> Difficulty: 17 Successes: 13</p> <p>I failed it. Will keep you updated.</p> <p>'Nother one:</p> <p>Taijutsu<br /> Wander the Sands<br /> You trek deep into the Outskirts, over crumbling ruins..<br /> Difficulty: 18 Successes: 13</p> <p>Succeded, didn't get an item.</p> <p>I just got this item, I'm pretty sure Sticky dropped it, but it doesn't say:<br /> Ew, you don't want to know where that came from.<br /> You found: Sticky Thread!<br /> (Total number: 1)<br /> It can't be sold and it isn't a craft item or distillable.</p>
