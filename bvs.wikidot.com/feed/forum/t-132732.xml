						 <p>ahh my mistake, I wasn't able to look at the player card before making my assumption. Sorry about that ^^</p> <p>Good luck with gaining members but remember that you need a successful village to complete the IM, and getting 70 upgrades with 15 from monsters is not very easy.</p>

						 <p>I can loop to season 5 at any time. I'm currently farming ryo and storybook pages so I can respec for Shady Dealings Lv 3. I thought I had more friends coming than I actually did, so I ended up a little short, but I'm good now. I just need to blow through S5 and do monochrome and a sannin run (and get the demon spirits), and I'll be ready for my last season.</p>

						 <p>Swan, by the looks of it, the OP is almost at Season 5 already. Yes, I agree that the OP made a big mistake by not asking other friends to join his village — the most important thing to a village is its villagers — but a person is still moving forward even when they fall on their faces.</p> <p>OP (assuming that you were in a village previously), trying asking your old village Kage if you can borrow a few members until you get F(8) up on a sturdy foundation.</p> <p>Also — Portwizard, that was uncalled for. I've been detecting some sort of conceited vibe from some of your posts lately. Gb2gaia/narutofan if you cannot play well with others.</p>

						 <p>Don't expect to run through season 3 extremely quick, and it does not matter if you are almost ready. You could be the best player in the world but you still need to get members and upgrades. As port said, you absolutely have a while to go before you can even think about completing the IM. Growing a village from the ground up is anything but easy.</p>

						 <p>As I said, I'M almost ready. I just need the village. A couple of my friends are asses and left me without enough people. There's no need for you to act like one as well.</p>

						 <p>We are growing fairly quickly, but we could use a few good players to help with spying and invading. We will have NRF within a few days, and an Enticement Altar in about 2 weeks. At that point, I will summon the first 8 kaiju, and possibly a few more after that. All active players and players with Terri 3 are welcome to join. :)</p>
