						 <p>Technically, you could start the mission pass all the parts up to and including the hanging out with both part, and continue the mission the next day with a fresh batch of stamina.</p>

						 <p>not necessarily. And really it'd suffice to get 70-80k, looking at it.</p> <p>In any case, you just need to have that many at one time. Friend points carry over to the next day and only reset if you hang out with them, or lose them (by looping, or otherwise).</p> <p>So basically You'd need to get and save up, say… 55k friend points in each just to be safe (if you go too high you might accidentally hang out with one and not the other, then need to start all over because the points reset). And then when you're ready, go ahead and rush through, trying to get 15k friend points that last day (which is actually a bit difficult). It just takes good timing, but you should be sure to save up enough stamina to do everything you need to that day (meaning running the special mission, and the 5 bingos which is at least 280 stamina).</p>

						 <p>Yeah it's all right there. You'd be safe getting anywhere between 90-100k friend points.</p>

						 <p><a href="http://www.animecubed.com/billy/friends.shtml">http://www.animecubed.com/billy/friends.shtml</a></p> <p>The list is there. Bold names are hanging out with the character. Anonymous is on top, and you can just scroll down for Right.</p> <p>Aside from what that list says, your guess is as good as mine, or anyone else's for that matter.</p> <p>Or… an easier method: Just hang out with one via friend points, and then hang out with the other via Make-out Mood Enhancer. If your village can't get rare ingredients, the arena has them for sale.</p>

						 <p>I need to know how many friend points I need to hang out with Right and Anonymous at the same time since I don't have the Floating on Air Theme and no one in my village has any Sham Rocks. Basically, just tell me the amount or a close approximated guess and list how many friend points for each one seperately.</p> <p>Right requires ____ Friend Points.</p> <p>Anonymous requires ____ Friend Points. Thanks! ^_^</p>
