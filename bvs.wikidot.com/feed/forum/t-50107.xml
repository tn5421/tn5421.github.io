						 <p>If your still looking to get rid of the note pages I'd be willing to trade you for them. I've got quite a few perms and some items I'm willing to let go, did you needed something specific?</p>

						 <p>News to me. AFAIK, the only themes that are note related at all are for having Anonymous Lvl 2 and for having Right Lvl 2. As for the original question, no there isn't really anything you can do with those pages except Bingo people. Still, you might as well uses them to at least get Hyuk and maybe get some Apples out of the deal.</p> <p>Actually, that would be a really nasty trick. Bingo some people you don't like, then immediately loop. You'll be basically immune to a direct retaliatory bingo since you'll be Genin and almost impossible to be tracked down except by Grim Predictions. Your victims would have to either blow the stamina or have the Chunin in their village try to bingo you, and since you'd be season 2+, you'd have a huge advantage over any season 1 Chunin targeting you without a note page.</p>

						 <p>I'm looping soon and haven't done anything in the Trade questline. Now I've got spare Note Pages but it seems stupid to waste 50 stam now when I'm looping soon. They can't be donated to the storehouse and doesn't sell.<br /> Anybody got a use for them? Otherwise they'll just have to rot until looping</p>
