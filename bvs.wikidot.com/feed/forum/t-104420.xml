						 <p>To bingo any ninja, your village must have a spy in the village that ninja is in.</p> <p>If you can't find the ninja the page where you select a bingo target: go to the ninja's player lookup, look at what village they are in, and try to get a spy into that village. Once that is done, you should be able to see them in your bingo book.</p>
