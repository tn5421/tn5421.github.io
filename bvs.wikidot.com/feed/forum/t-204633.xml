						 <p>Alright, thanks a bunch. I've reached The Holy Ground AND beaten Burger Ninja, so I guess I'll be looping soon. :)</p>

						 <p>Season 2? In R00t, you should probably stop after reaching Hidden Forbidden Holy Ground. At that point, your hardest challenges are 20d20s, but afterwards you start hitting the 35d40s, and unless you have a ton of Kaiju luck, it's more efficient to start looping than to recompile to beat it.</p> <p>PizzaWitch you won't get very far in at all, even if you grind your Dou up as high as you can, as there are more hard G/N/T checks along the way. I wouldn't go past Burger Ninja, if you manage to beat it.</p>

						 <p>Exactly how far would you all say a S2 could get in r00t and Pizzawitch? I like to try getting as much done as possible each season before I loop, such as getting almost all possible allies, finishing all quests, etc. I've finished almost everything else, but these two seem especially difficult, even though they are still available to S2+</p>
