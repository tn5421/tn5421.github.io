						 <p>Does anyone know what happens if you hang-out with both Lil' Whitey <em>and</em> Stalkergirl on the hang-out requirement? I'd assume you fail, but maybe there's something there? Actually on second thought, McM wouldn't put anything in a place you can't get back to like that. But maybe hang-out with both afterward?</p>
