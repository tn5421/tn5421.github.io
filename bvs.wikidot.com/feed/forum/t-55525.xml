						 <p>This isn't "people still complaining", this is a repost of a log that's…I want to say over a year old by now.</p> <p>In fact, I'm sure it is, because the log was originally posted on the Random forums, before BvS had a forum of its own.</p> <p>Also, as you can see, giffica failed simple math.</p>

						 <p>people are still complaining about this? it's simple!</p> <p>if the total price is 510 and the price of the case is 500 more than the tag then use the formula:</p> <p><strong>500 + 2x = 510</strong></p> <p>where x is the price of the tag and from there you do this:</p> <p><strong>2x = 510 - 500</strong></p> <p>which reduces to:</p> <p><strong>2x = 10</strong></p> <p>solve for x:</p> <p><strong>x = 10/2</strong></p> <p>which means x or the tag is equal to 5 ryo.</p> <p>now if you give the person 100 ryo for the 5 ryo tag, you get:</p> <p><strong>100 - 5 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>95</em></span></strong></p> <p>like i said simple math.</p>

						 <p>[09:34:28] * Giffica (<span class="wiki-email">moc.tibbim.7BAFEE2E-CRIad|156226c4#moc.tibbim.7BAFEE2E-CRIad|156226c4</span>) has joined #bvswiki<br /> [09:34:37] &lt;Giffica&gt; Uzuki need help<br /> [09:36:12] &lt;Giffica&gt; How do you get headband to show?<br /> [09:41:08] &lt;Giffica&gt; Oh and tell people to stop changing the layton puzzle 5 to 95! Its 90! It cant be 95 unless there is a number that has 5 in it! They can do it on a calculator if they want to test it.<br /> [09:47:44] &lt;Giffica&gt; You there cause i dont want to get in trouble for putting that and when i tried it i got it correct by putting 90. I have 4 villagers do that and they got it correct.<br /> [10:06:37] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Don't play with the Layton puzzle.<br /> [10:07:01] &lt;Uzuki&gt; For the headband, just go to the Wiki Village page and view the source. You have to upload the file to your village page. You can do that by using the file button at the bottom.<br /> [10:11:14] &lt;Uzuki&gt; The answer is 95.<br /> [10:12:04] &lt;Giffica&gt; No it is not! Calculate it! I sware! What is 510-500? Then do 100-10 What does that one equal?<br /> [10:12:08] &lt;Uzuki&gt; The cost of the tag is 500 + x = cost of tag. Case = X. Tag + Case = 510.<br /> [10:12:33] &lt;Uzuki&gt; If X is 5, then the cost of the case is 5, and the cost of the tag is 505. And the two combined is 510.<br /> [10:22:22] &lt;Giffica&gt; No because than it would be 505 more! it has to b 500 more!<br /> [10:22:44] &lt;Giffica&gt; Its wrong uzuki! I know for a fact. I sent a Pm to mods in game to eaither change question or change answer<br /> [10:23:04] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Do not change it again.<br /> [10:23:32] &lt;Uzuki&gt; It's not my problem if you don't understand math.<br /> [10:23:37] &lt;Uzuki&gt; But 90 is the wrong answer.<br /> [10:23:49] &lt;Giffica&gt; You are saying it costs 505 more but it says it must be 500 more<br /> [10:23:59] &lt;Uzuki&gt; No.<br /> [10:24:33] &lt;Uzuki&gt; 500 more than the case. So the tag alone is 500+case cost.<br /> [10:24:41] &lt;Uzuki&gt; If you want the tag and the case, it's 500+case cost+case cost.<br /> [10:24:54] &lt;Uzuki&gt; And since the two together cost 510, the case costs 5.<br /> [10:25:07] &lt;Giffica&gt; Listen to your own logic! "f X is 5, then the cost of the case is 5, and the cost of the tag is 505. And the two combined is 510." Now before that you said the case is x! You cant have to x's. You can have a y but there are 2 variable's in the equation not 3!<br /> [10:26:03] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Why can't you have two X's?<br /> [10:26:11] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Since X is always the same value.<br /> [10:26:25] &lt;Giffica&gt; The tag is 500 more than the case leaving 10! If its 5 you havw 5 left over so where does that come from! I wont change it but i will argue it!<br /> [10:26:37] &lt;Uzuki&gt; You're not understanding.<br /> [10:26:51] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Okay, lets use your math. You think the case costs 10, right?<br /> [10:26:58] &lt;Giffica&gt; But you only have 1 count them 1! x not 2. If x is 5 you need to oh them but you have only 1 case. not 2 of them meaning everything together is 505<br /> [10:27:00] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Stop<br /> [10:27:04] &lt;Uzuki&gt; You think the case costs 10, right?<br /> [10:27:07] &lt;Giffica&gt; yes it does<br /> [10:27:10] &lt;Uzuki&gt; How much does the tag cost?<br /> [10:27:14] &lt;Giffica&gt; 500<br /> [10:27:16] &lt;Uzuki&gt; No.<br /> [10:27:19] &lt;Uzuki&gt; The tag costs 500 more than the case.<br /> [10:27:24] &lt;Uzuki&gt; It says that right in the question.<br /> [10:27:30] &lt;Giffica&gt; yeh exatly<br /> [10:27:31] &lt;Uzuki&gt; So how much does the case cost if the tag costs 10.<br /> [10:28:01] &lt;Giffica&gt; the tag cost 500 not 10<br /> [10:28:05] &lt;Uzuki&gt; No.<br /> [10:28:11] &lt;Uzuki&gt; The tag is 500 more than the case.<br /> [10:28:18] &lt;Uzuki&gt; 500+cost of case = cost of tag<br /> [10:28:27] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Since 500 more than means you're doing addition.<br /> [10:28:47] &lt;Uzuki&gt; It says it right here "You ask how much the tag is, and they say it costs 500 more than the case. "<br /> [10:28:48] &lt;Giffica&gt; yh 10+500=510<br /> [10:29:01] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Okay, so now you're saying the cost of the case is 510.<br /> [10:29:04] &lt;Giffica&gt; they arent asking you the tag! They want the case!<br /> [10:29:06] &lt;Uzuki&gt; So what's the cost of the case and the tag?<br /> [10:29:20] &lt;Uzuki&gt; If you're saying the case is 10, and the tag is 510, how much do they cost together?<br /> [10:29:29] &lt;Giffica&gt; no together its 510 separate the tag is 500 and the case is 10<br /> [10:29:33] &lt;Uzuki&gt; No.<br /> [10:29:41] &lt;Giffica&gt; then what is the case?<br /> [10:29:41] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Start over.<br /> [10:29:48] &lt;Uzuki&gt; The case is 5.<br /> [10:29:49] &lt;Giffica&gt; No first tell me the case<br /> [10:30:00] &lt;Giffica&gt; so how can 500+5=510?<br /> [10:30:07] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Because it's 500+5+5<br /> [10:30:28] &lt;Giffica&gt; Ok wht is the proce of everything?<br /> [10:30:34] &lt;Uzuki&gt; The tag costs 505, the case costs 5. The price of everything together is 510.<br /> [10:30:36] &lt;Giffica&gt; Where do you get the other 5!<br /> [10:30:44] &lt;Giffica&gt; no the tag is 500<br /> [10:30:44] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Okay, we'll start again.<br /> [10:31:00] &lt;Uzuki&gt; No, it says the tag is 500 more than the case. So it's the cost of the case (5) plus 500 (505).<br /> [10:31:03] &lt;Giffica&gt; they arent saying it cost 505 more they say its exactly 500 more<br /> [10:31:24] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Yes, it's exactly 500 more than the cost of the case. Which means it's the cost of the case + 500.<br /> [10:31:28] &lt;Uzuki&gt; To get the price of the tag.<br /> [10:31:30] &lt;Giffica&gt; meaning the tag is 500 more!<br /> [10:31:42] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Right. The tag is 500 more than the case. If the case costs 5, that means the tag costs 505.<br /> [10:31:58] &lt;Giffica&gt; there are 2 variable's correct? If so how do you get 500+5+5?<br /> [10:32:06] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Okay, stay with me again.<br /> [10:32:34] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Case costs 5. The tag costs 500 + 5. The case and the tag together costs (500+5) for the tag, and another (+5) for the case. Total is 510.<br /> [10:32:41] &lt;Giffica&gt; i am! You are making no sense! if the tag is 500 more(meaning its 500) than th remainder is 10<br /> [10:32:50] &lt;Uzuki&gt; 500 more doesn't mean 500.<br /> [10:32:52] &lt;Giffica&gt; how does the tag cost 500+5<br /> [10:33:07] &lt;Uzuki&gt; If you're younger sister is 5 years old, and you have 5 more years than her, are you 5 years old?<br /> [10:33:08] &lt;Giffica&gt; yeh but in that sense it could be eaither<br /> [10:33:16] &lt;Giffica&gt; no i am 10<br /> [10:33:18] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Right.<br /> [10:33:29] &lt;Uzuki&gt; So if the tag costs 500 more than the case, and the case costs 5, wouldn't that mean the case is 505?<br /> [10:33:31] &lt;Giffica&gt; yeh<br /> [10:33:40] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Okay, so if all you have is the case, that's 505.<br /> [10:33:49] &lt;Uzuki&gt; And you know the cost of the case and the tag together is 505+5. Meaning it's 510.<br /> [10:33:58] &lt;Giffica&gt; no cause if thats the case than when you giv 100 you cant buy a case<br /> [10:34:12] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Gah, I meant Tag when I said 505.<br /> [10:34:14] &lt;Giffica&gt; togather they are 500<br /> [10:34:17] &lt;Giffica&gt; and 10<br /> [10:34:18] &lt;Uzuki&gt; No, together they are 510.<br /> [10:34:34] &lt;Giffica&gt; no cause the tag is 500<br /> [10:34:36] &lt;Uzuki&gt; No.<br /> [10:34:38] &lt;Giffica&gt; more than the case<br /> [10:34:40] &lt;Uzuki&gt; The tag is 500 more than the case.<br /> [10:34:44] &lt;Uzuki&gt; So the case has to cost something.<br /> [10:34:51] &lt;Giffica&gt; if the case is 5 than the tag would be 505 more<br /> [10:35:00] &lt;Uzuki&gt; No, it'd be 500 more. Which totals to 505.<br /> [10:35:23] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Have you taken Algebra I in school yet?<br /> [10:35:29] &lt;Giffica&gt; yeh geometry<br /> [10:35:35] &lt;Giffica&gt; ok listen.<br /> [10:35:37] &lt;Uzuki&gt; No.<br /> [10:35:41] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Have you taken Algebra?<br /> [10:35:47] * Angelg (~<span class="wiki-email">moc.rr.zib.syn.8D60773D-CRIad|alliztahc#moc.rr.zib.syn.8D60773D-CRIad|alliztahc</span>) has joined #bvswiki<br /> [10:35:49] * Yukio|RIP_RandyPausch (~<span class="wiki-email">ten.nozirev.tsae.jnkrwn.A0A2321D-CRIad|alliztahc#ten.nozirev.tsae.jnkrwn.A0A2321D-CRIad|alliztahc</span>) has joined #bvswiki<br /> [10:35:57] * L (~<span class="wiki-email">moc.rr.ser.retsehcor.6261DF1-CRIad|alliztahc#moc.rr.ser.retsehcor.6261DF1-CRIad|alliztahc</span>) has joined #bvswiki<br /> [10:36:03] &lt;Yukio|RIP_RandyPausch&gt; so much love here<br /> [10:36:13] * Uzuki changes topic to 'Love is the answer.'<br /> [10:36:17] &lt;Giffica&gt; the tag is 500 correct? with th case its 510. - the cost of the tag from the tag+case you get a remainder of 10. Meaning the case is 10!<br /> [10:36:19] &lt;Angelg&gt; I just heard that a PHAIL in math was here<br /> [10:36:21] &lt;Yukio|RIP_RandyPausch&gt; what is love?<br /> [10:36:32] &lt;Uzuki&gt; The tag isn't 500.<br /> [10:36:34] &lt;Uzuki&gt; The tag is 505.<br /> [10:36:35] &lt;Angelg&gt; ………….PHAIL<br /> [10:36:37] &lt;Angelg&gt; Geez<br /> [10:36:41] &lt;Giffica&gt; Than what is it?<br /> [10:36:41] &lt;Angelg&gt; THAT problem AGAIN?<br /> [10:36:48] &lt;Angelg&gt; Okay, easy language<br /> [10:36:48] &lt;Giffica&gt; how is that possible<br /> [10:36:53] &lt;Uzuki&gt; I've gone over this 8 times now.<br /> [10:36:58] &lt;Angelg&gt; The tag is 500 MORE than the case<br /> [10:36:59] &lt;Uzuki&gt; The tag is 500+cost of the case.<br /> [10:37:02] &lt;Angelg&gt; Yes<br /> [10:37:11] &lt;Uzuki&gt; So, the cost of the tag&amp;case together is 500+cost of case+cost of case.<br /> [10:37:25] &lt;Uzuki&gt; So, if the total is 510, then cost of case must be 5.<br /> [10:37:42] &lt;Angelg&gt; Okay, going the other way….IF the case is 10 ryo and tag is 500 ryo….is the tag 500 MORE than the case? The answer is NO<br /> [10:37:47] &lt;Giffica&gt; there is 1 count them 1 case!<br /> [10:37:57] &lt;Uzuki&gt; I know there's 1 case.<br /> [10:38:02] &lt;Angelg&gt; Uzuki<br /> [10:38:02] &lt;Giffica&gt; "of case+cost of case." you say there are 2<br /> [10:38:07] &lt;Angelg&gt; Let me try this<br /> [10:38:10] &lt;Uzuki&gt; But the cost of the tag is 500+cost of case.<br /> [10:38:18] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Even though you're not buying a case, it's still 500+cost of case.<br /> [10:38:19] &lt;Angelg&gt; Screw that, just go the other way<br /> [10:38:23] &lt;L&gt; …<br /> [10:38:26] &lt;Angelg&gt; The point is giffica is flat out WRONG<br /> [10:38:28] &lt;Giffica&gt; no th tag is 500 more than the case! Not plus the case<br /> [10:38:37] &lt;Uzuki&gt; 500 more than the case is 500+case cost.<br /> [10:38:38] &lt;Uzuki&gt; It's the same thing.<br /> [10:38:56] &lt;Angelg&gt; Uzuki, don't use such hard examples<br /> [10:38:59] * Nusteid (~<span class="wiki-email">ten.htuoslleb.aim.AC7B79B2-CRIad|alliztahc#ten.htuoslleb.aim.AC7B79B2-CRIad|alliztahc</span>) has joined #bvswiki<br /> [10:39:05] &lt;Angelg&gt; Its easy to prove he's WRONG<br /> [10:39:07] &lt;Angelg&gt; Simply put<br /> [10:39:19] &lt;Angelg&gt; Giffica is saying the Case is 10 ryo and the tag is 500 ryo<br /> [10:39:21] &lt;Angelg&gt; Now<br /> [10:39:32] &lt;Giffica&gt; You are saying the answer is 5+5+500<br /> [10:39:35] &lt;L&gt; Yep<br /> [10:39:37] &lt;L&gt; wait<br /> [10:39:39] &lt;Angelg&gt; In that case, Just listen<br /> [10:39:42] &lt;Angelg&gt; Look<br /> [10:39:43] &lt;L&gt; not the answer, the total…<br /> [10:39:55] &lt;Angelg&gt; You are CLAIMING that the case is 10 ryo, tag 500 ryo<br /> [10:39:57] &lt;Angelg&gt; Now<br /> [10:40:01] &lt;Angelg&gt; IN THAT CASE<br /> [10:40:01] &lt;Giffica&gt; yeh<br /> [10:40:10] &lt;Angelg&gt; How much more does the tag cost than the case?<br /> [10:40:16] &lt;Giffica&gt; 500<br /> [10:40:30] &lt;Angelg&gt; How much MORE<br /> [10:40:31] &lt;L&gt; …<br /> [10:40:32] &lt;Giffica&gt; meaning 510 alltogether<br /> [10:40:38] &lt;Angelg&gt; ………Can you read?<br /> [10:40:51] &lt;Giffica&gt; 500 more it says that!<br /> [10:40:54] &lt;Angelg&gt; You claim the tag costs 500, case as 10.<br /> [10:40:56] &lt;Angelg&gt; ….Oh<br /> [10:41:07] &lt;Angelg&gt; So the tag costs 500 MORE than the price of case?<br /> [10:41:10] &lt;Giffica&gt; mmhhmm<br /> [10:41:16] &lt;Giffica&gt; yeh<br /> [10:41:19] &lt;Giffica&gt; like it says<br /> [10:41:21] &lt;Angelg&gt; Meaning price of case (10) + 500 (tag) = 500?<br /> [10:41:29] &lt;Angelg&gt; You need to go learn addition then<br /> [10:41:36] &lt;Angelg&gt; You can't read, or you can't count<br /> [10:41:38] &lt;Giffica&gt; meaning the case is 10<br /> [10:41:42] &lt;Angelg&gt; Yes<br /> [10:41:51] &lt;Angelg&gt; And the tag is 500 ryo MORE than the price of case<br /> [10:41:55] &lt;Giffica&gt; no meaning is 510 altogether<br /> [10:41:58] &lt;Angelg&gt; Do you know what the word MORE means?<br /> [10:41:58] &lt;Giffica&gt; yes<br /> [10:42:01] &lt;L&gt; …<br /> [10:42:02] &lt;Angelg&gt; So<br /> [10:42:07] &lt;Angelg&gt; IF the tag is 500 ryo<br /> [10:42:12] &lt;Angelg&gt; Err<br /> [10:42:18] &lt;Giffica&gt; yeh more is 500 more than the case whitch is 10!<br /> [10:42:23] &lt;Angelg&gt; Wow<br /> [10:42:25] &lt;L&gt; …<br /> [10:42:34] &lt;Giffica&gt; . yeh the tag is 500 ryo<br /> [10:42:36] &lt;Angelg&gt; I never knew you couldn't count<br /> [10:42:37] &lt;L&gt; NO NO NO NO NO NO NON ONO NO<br /> [10:42:45] * L facepalms<br /> [10:42:45] &lt;Giffica&gt; whats is the tag than<br /> [10:42:48] &lt;L&gt; Okay<br /> [10:42:51] &lt;L&gt; look at it this way<br /> [10:43:05] &lt;L&gt; you have case + tag = 510 ryo, yeah?<br /> [10:43:23] &lt;Angelg&gt; L, it won't work….he doesn't know what the word MORE means<br /> [10:43:27] &lt;L&gt; &lt;_&lt;<br /> [10:43:31] &lt;L&gt; I am aware<br /> [10:43:35] &lt;L&gt; I won't use the word more.<br /> [10:43:37] &lt;Giffica&gt; u there<br /> [10:43:44] &lt;Giffica&gt; yeh l<br /> [10:43:52] &lt;L&gt; Giffica, shut up and listen.<br /> [10:44:00] &lt;Giffica&gt; tak than<br /> [10:44:01] &lt;L&gt; The Case + the Tag totals 510<br /> [10:44:04] &lt;L&gt; now then<br /> [10:44:16] &lt;L&gt; the case costs 500 PLUS the cost of the tag<br /> [10:44:21] &lt;L&gt; err<br /> [10:44:24] &lt;L&gt; tag, not case<br /> [10:44:29] &lt;Giffica&gt; switch<br /> [10:44:39] &lt;L&gt; The tag costs 500 PLUS the cost of the case.<br /> [10:44:40] &lt;L&gt; yeah.<br /> [10:44:43] &lt;Giffica&gt; yeh<br /> [10:45:06] &lt;Giffica&gt; Now Listen to me.<br /> [10:45:08] &lt;L&gt; So, if the case is ten, then the tag MUST, by the information given, cost 510 ryo.

yeh<br /> [10:47:52] &lt;Angelg&gt; Then for the tag to be 500 MORE than case<br /> [10:47:57] &lt;Giffica&gt; the tag is 509 meaning over 500<br /> [10:48:02] &lt;Angelg&gt; The tag has to cost 501<br /> [10:48:13] &lt;Angelg&gt;

WHAT IF<br /> [10:52:13] &lt;Angelg&gt; Listen<br /> [10:52:15] &lt;Angelg&gt; WHAT IF<br /> [10:52:24] &lt;Angelg&gt; The tag costs 505 ryo<br /> [10:52:29] &lt;Angelg&gt; How much will the case be?<br /> [10:52:41] &lt;Giffica&gt;

IF the tag is 505 and the case is 5<br /> [10:53:38] &lt;Angelg&gt; How much MORE is the tag than the case?<br /> [10:53:40] &lt;Giffica&gt; yes so 10(case)+500(tag)=what!<br /> [10:53:45] &lt;Yukio|RIP_RandyPausch&gt;

510!<br /> [10:57:37] &lt;Angelg&gt; Yeah, but what does the PROBLEM say?<br /> [10:57:47] &lt;Giffica&gt; More than the case!<br /> [10:57:54] &lt;Angelg&gt; It says the TAG costs 500 more than the case<br /> [10:57:57] &lt;Giffica&gt; 510 is 500 more than the case<br /> [10:58:02] &lt;Angelg&gt; Forget that part<br /> [10:58:08] &lt;Giffica&gt; if it equals 10<br /> [10:58:17] &lt;Angelg&gt; Well, lets follow your numbers then….<br /> [10:58:28] &lt;Angelg&gt; You are saying, case costs 10 and tag costs 500<br /> [10:58:29] &lt;Angelg&gt; Right?<br /> [10:58:48] &lt;Angelg&gt; The problem says the TAG costs 500 more than the case<br /> [10:58:57] &lt;Angelg&gt; Is the case + 500 = tag?<br /> [10:59:05] &lt;Giffica&gt; ok<br /> [10:59:15] &lt;Giffica&gt; no<br /> [10:59:21] &lt;Angelg&gt; Thus you are wrong<br /> [10:59:26] &lt;Giffica&gt; thats 510<br /> [10:59:32] &lt;Angelg&gt; The problem is saying that the TAG costs 500 more than the case<br /> [10:59:37] &lt;Angelg&gt; Do you understand that?<br /> [10:59:51] &lt;Giffica&gt; count from 10 to 510 starting with 10 what do you get?<br /> [10:59:57] &lt;Angelg&gt; 500<br /> [10:59:59] &lt;Angelg&gt; Now<br /> [11:00:06] &lt;Angelg&gt; Did you say the tag costs 510 tho?<br /> [11:00:08] &lt;Giffica&gt; Your answer would be 500 meaning its 500 more than 10 (case<br /> [11:00:13] &lt;Angelg&gt; You said the tag costs 500<br /> [11:00:14] &lt;Giffica&gt; no<br /> [11:00:16] &lt;Giffica&gt; yes<br /> [11:00:27] &lt;Angelg&gt; So<br /> [11:00:31] &lt;Angelg&gt; Counting from 10 to 500<br /> [11:00:37] &lt;Angelg&gt; Is the tag 500 MORE than the case?<br /> [11:00:39] &lt;Angelg&gt; No<br /> [11:00:42] &lt;Angelg&gt; Its only 490 more<br /> [11:00:44] &lt;Angelg&gt; WHICH IS WRONG<br /> [11:00:51] &lt;Angelg&gt; 510 is the TOTAL<br /> [11:00:51] &lt;Giffica&gt; 500 from case(10) =500 or add them to get 510<br /> [11:01:07] &lt;Giffica&gt; no its 490 correct<br /> [11:01:10] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Giffica: 510 is the cost of BOTH the case and te tag, right?<br /> [11:01:19] &lt;Giffica&gt; tbut count from 10 to 510<br /> [11:01:33] &lt;Giffica&gt; yes or addd together<br /> [11:01:44] &lt;Angelg&gt; Giffica, answer this: is the 510 the cost of TAG, or TAG AND CASE?<br /> [11:01:54] &lt;Angelg&gt; What does the problem say?<br /> [11:02:56] &lt;Giffica&gt; The Ninja Shop has a new item! Get a Special Explosive Tag, and the case to hold it, for only 510 Ryo. You ask how much the tag is, and they say it costs 500 more than the case. You just want the case. If you give them 100 Ryo for it, how much change should you get back?<br /> [11:03:05] &lt;Giffica&gt; ok let me talk<br /> [11:03:11] &lt;Angelg&gt; Go<br /> [11:03:50] &lt;Giffica&gt; "Get a Special Explosive Tag, and the case to hold it, for only 510 Ryo"<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-Ok so this means that if you add them together you get 510 correct? Now add 500 and 10 you get that, correct?<br /> [11:03:59] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Incorrect.<br /> [11:04:00] &lt;Giffica&gt; wait not done<br /> [11:04:09] &lt;Giffica&gt; yes how is 500+10 not 50<br /> [11:04:10] &lt;Giffica&gt; 0<br /> [11:04:17] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Because that's not what's being asked.<br /> [11:04:18] &lt;Giffica&gt; 510<br /> [11:04:18] &lt;Giffica&gt; sorry<br /> [11:04:23] &lt;Giffica&gt; yes it is!<br /> [11:04:26] &lt;Uzuki&gt; No, it's not.<br /> [11:04:29] &lt;Giffica&gt; listen! i said im not one<br /> [11:04:31] &lt;Giffica&gt; done<br /> [11:04:44] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Yes, but you've already made a mistake…so there's no point in going on.<br /> [11:05:02] &lt;Angelg&gt; You ask how much the tag is, and they say it costs 500 more than the case.<br /> [11:05:10] &lt;Angelg&gt; The keyword, MORE<br /> [11:05:19] &lt;Angelg&gt; Meaning<br /> [11:05:24] &lt;Angelg&gt; Cost of Tag = case + 500<br /> [11:05:49] &lt;Giffica&gt; "You ask how much the tag is, and they say it costs 500 more than the case."</span>-This part says that the tag is 500 more than the case (Or 500 from 10) Meaning if you count from 10 to 510 the differance is 500 take the 500MORE and add that to the case or 500 MORE+10=510<br /> [11:06:02] &lt;Giffica&gt; yes so to get to 510 you hav to have 10<br /> [11:06:04] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Hang on, you're making things worse.<br /> [11:06:11] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Giffica: Can the Tag cost 500 ryo?<br /> [11:06:15] &lt;Giffica&gt; yes<br /> [11:06:24] &lt;Giffica&gt; thts 500 MORE than 10<br /> [11:06:33] &lt;Uzuki&gt; So, 500 is 500 more than 10?<br /> [11:06:42] &lt;Giffica&gt; no 510 is!<br /> [11:06:44] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Right.<br /> [11:06:53] &lt;Uzuki&gt; So, the case can't cost 500, right?<br /> [11:07:12] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Sorry, the tag can't cost more than 500.<br /> [11:07:18] &lt;Uzuki&gt; I keep getting those words mixed up.<br /> [11:07:36] &lt;Uzuki&gt; To say it again: The tag can't cost 500 ryo, right? Because 500 ryo can't be 500 more than anything but zero. And the case can't cost zero. Right?<br /> [11:07:39] &lt;Giffica&gt; Oh and so you know when i did it i put in 90 with one of my characters and 99 with another both worked<br /> [11:07:49] &lt;Giffica&gt; no but 510 is<br /> [11:08:16] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Okay. 510 would be 500 more than 10. That's right. Okay, but if the tag costs 510, and the cost of the case and tag is 510, how much would the case cost?<br /> [11:09:14] &lt;Giffica&gt; 10! yeh so togetehr they are 510<br /> [11:09:16] &lt;Angelg&gt; Gotta reload, brb<br /> [11:09:20] * Angelg (~<span class="wiki-email">moc.rr.zib.syn.8D60773D-CRIad|alliztahc#moc.rr.zib.syn.8D60773D-CRIad|alliztahc</span>) Quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.83 [Firefox 2.0.0.16/2008070205])<br /> [11:09:22] &lt;Giffica&gt; you only add the case once<br /> [11:09:27] &lt;Uzuki&gt; No, you add it twice.<br /> [11:09:44] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Once to figure out the price of the tag alone (since the tag costs 500 more than the case), and a second time to figure out the cost of the case and the tag together.<br /> [11:10:00] &lt;Giffica&gt; how<br /> [11:10:07] &lt;Giffica&gt; there are 2 variable's<br /> [11:10:08] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Okay…lets try again.<br /> [11:10:11] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Stop with the variables.<br /> [11:10:13] * Angelg (~<span class="wiki-email">moc.rr.zib.syn.8D60773D-CRIad|alliztahc#moc.rr.zib.syn.8D60773D-CRIad|alliztahc</span>) has joined #bvswiki<br /> [11:10:13] &lt;Uzuki&gt; I don't think you understand them.<br /> [11:10:29] &lt;Uzuki&gt; How much do you think the case costs?<br /> [11:10:34] &lt;Giffica&gt; not 3<br /> [11:10:40] &lt;Uzuki&gt; Okay.

WHat i asked of the mods is to change the question or the answer.
