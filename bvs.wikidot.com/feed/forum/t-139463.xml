						 <p>Sitting at the <em>End of Time</em> you realize Hope is not lost, something can be done, you board on <em>Epoch</em> and leave on an adventure.</p> <p><strong>Your travel through Times set you back in 65,000,000&nbsp;B.C.</strong></p> <p>As you walk in the nearest village, and head toward the town hall, a Red-headed ninja walks toward you and shouts:</p> <p>"You in the Orange Jump Suit! Yes You! Sit Down Now!"<br /> "Make yourselves at home, the pterodactyl stew is getting out of the oven and will be served soon with warm stegosaurus milk. By the way, I am GORIUM, and I'm glad you're here today!"</p> <p>As you sit down and embrace the moment, a member of the Village Council comes to you and invites you: <a href="http://s1.zetaboards.com/Lavos_Village/">http://s1.zetaboards.com/Lavos_Village/</a>.</p> <p>"Let's get ready for the <em>Day of Lavos</em>."</p> <p>Your decision will change Times.</p> <p>gorium<br /> Member of the Village Council in Lavos Village</p>
