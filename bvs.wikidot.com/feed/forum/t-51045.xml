						 <p>well no,</p> <p>if the case is 10 Bucks and the Tag is 500 more than the Tag would cost 510! plus the 10 for the case would be 520 … but all together it's 510!</p> <p>so the tag is 5 Bucks! cuz if the Tag costs 500 more it's 505 for the tag and 5 for the case! together that'd cost ya 510 just as it's asked…</p> <p>so you get back 95 bucks</p>

						 <p>Billy vs Snakeman has updated some of their puzzles a bit. I'm stuck on the 5th one. It oges like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Puzzle No. 5<br /> Just the Case</p> <p>The Ninja Shop has a new item! Get a Special Explosive Tag, and the case to hold it, for only 510 Ryo. You ask how much the tag is, and they say it costs 500 more than the case. You just want the case. If you give them 100 Ryo for it, how much change should you get back?</p> <p>And here's the hint:</p> <p>WRONG! Here's a hint: Make sure that the prices you've came up with agree with everything in the question. Is the Tag 500 more than the case? If so, how much is the case by itself?</p> </blockquote> <p>If the whole set is 510 ryo and the tag costs 500 more than the case, then case is obiously 10 ryo. Now, I want the case and give 100 ryo, so I should be getting back 90 ryo. If all of you agree with me, I'm submitting this to the bug report.</p>
