						 <p>I can't solo any kaiju at my current level and number of allies… And even if I could, that'd be a dumb thing to do. &gt;.&gt;</p>

						 <p>Eh, I don't have too much interest in getting into this too deeply. I want to say "Just use common sense" but that probably won't cut it.</p> <p>If you want to "freeze" yourself at your most powerful moment, I think that makes sense. That way you don't have the rank down problem.</p> <p>Re: Season three chunin stronger than a season one Jonin… I don't see a problem with that, if it's done well. I mean, Naruto in Shuppudden can be understood as a Season 2+ genin who's definitely stronger than some Jonin we see at the start of Naruto in Season 1.</p> <p>My main concern is a brand new player who's just passed the chunin exam claiming they're Sannin level in power. Celeste, who can solo some kaiju even as an S3 Chunin roleplaying being powerful doesn't worry me :P</p> <p>Likewise, if EvilTaxi wanted to be a Sannin level powerful Genin…I'd be hard pressed to say that he's not that powerful, even as a Genin.</p>

						 <p>I think argent meant, what if you looped while in the middle of an existing roleplay? Suddenly, while chatting… RANK DOWN! Weirdness indeed.</p> <p>A question of my own: Are season three chunin stronger than season one jonin? =o</p>

						 <p>Think of looping like a new season of a TV show. Having some explanation as to where your power went would be good. You could claim you got amnesia, or just say that part of your new training is to clear your mind entirely. Another option is to consider your current season the child of your last season or something.</p>

						 <p>Question regarding #2…</p> <blockquote> <p>An attempt should be made to have your roleplay stick close to your actual abilities in BvS. For example, you should not roleplay using Attack on the Nervous System unless your character actually knows that jutsu.</p> </blockquote> <p>How do we deal with looping? argent, for example, had pretty close to every RedEye technique, and now he's a genin… wait, I blinked. Chunin. Any rp-situation we're in could result in interesting twists and characters suddenly jump from Sanin to Genin.</p>

						 <p>Greetings!</p> <p>This forum is intended to provide BvS players a place where they can add some depth to their character that would not ordinarily be provided in the game. Here, you can submit stories, background information, and setup "Bar" style places where players can hang out and interact "in character."</p> <p>However, the following rules are in effect.</p> <ol> <li><strong>All Roleplaying in this forum is to be about <em>Billy Vs. SNAKEMAN</em></strong>. This is not a Naruto/Bleach/Death Note Roleplaying Forum.</li> <li><strong>An attempt should be made to have your roleplay stick close to your actual abilities in <em>BvS</em></strong>. For example, you should not roleplay using <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/jutsu:attack-on-the-nervous-system">Attack on the Nervous System</a> unless your character actually knows that jutsu.</li> <li><strong>The power of your character should be reasonable</strong>. A Genin should lose to a Jonin in most circumstances. Your ninja is not an under appreciated genius who's a low rank now, despite the fact that you think he's all powerful.</li> <li><strong>Play your Bloodline appropriately</strong>. RedEyes poked themselves in the eye and their eyes stayed red. It is not the Sharingan. WhiteEyes got something in their eye, and it stayed white, they don't have the Byakkugan. Similarly, Legacy characters poked their eye out, they don't have the nine-tailed fox sealed within them. You can take some liberties with this, to some degree. For example, a legacy character might claim that a spirit has been sealed in their missing eye-socket. Just be reasonable, don't just rip stuff off from Naruto wholesale, at least make a joke about it.</li> <li><strong>You are not Naruto's long lost brother</strong>. You're not even Billy's long lost brother. Your character should have its own distinct history, not just be some leech latching onto major characters to fill in backstory you don't want to write. However, you can claim a prominent ally has trained you (i.e., "Student of K-Dog" or "Received special training from Shorty".)</li> <li><strong>The only one who can kill your character is you</strong>. Do not attempt (or claim) to kill someone else's character without their express permission in writing.</li> <li><strong>Have fun with it!</strong> <em>Billy Vs. SNAKEMAN</em> shouldn't be taken too seriously. If you're not having fun, something's wrong.</li> </ol> <p>More rules may be added as is appropriate.</p> <p>If this forum goes well, I'm thinking we might add an "rp" category to the main site to preserve some of the more interesting takes that get posted here. But I thought this would add to a greater sense of community, and for some, increase the depth of their BvS experience.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p>
