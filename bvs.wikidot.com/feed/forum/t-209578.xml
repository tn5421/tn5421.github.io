						 <p>Hi there<br /> A long time ago the Kaiju Drizz made his way to the realms. Unfortunately he did not found a new village but helped out others to get to the realm.</p> <p>But now ages later, this time passed by and the Drizz is know settling down and begins a new with a lovely charmed village.</p> <p>Zangetsu the Village hidden in the zanpoktu is because of that looking now for old, young and alternate Ninjas who like to help biuld up a village and get everything we need to be lucky together.</p> <p>The firsts to come have a special seat in the council.</p> <p>So if u'd like to help Drizz or just join a new but fast growing village just send a application.</p> <p>I, the Drizz would be very glad to welcome you to my village</p>
