						 <p>So I need another bingo (with note page, of course) for Anon. If anyone could do this for me, I would greatly appreciate it.</p> <p>My stats: Lear/Level 51/The Wiki Village</p> <p>Of course, I'm willing to bingo you in exchange. I've held back on getting Right specifically for that reason. Just leave your Village and name. Also, make sure your village isn't in peacetime (+4 or more) or too small to spy on easily. I have a pretty good range, but I can't hit everything.</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
