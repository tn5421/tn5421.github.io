						 <p>From what I understand, when you take the Special Mission to loop, there will be a list showing the items in your inventory that will loop, and probably showing what doesn't.</p> <p>Permanent items weren't the focus of this update though. The main focus was items like Smokebombs, potions ( such as Make-Out Mood Enhancers, Monochrome Phermones, etc. ), and other such common and/or consumable items that people would, as mentioned, just dump into the storehouse, then take back out after they loop.</p> <p>The store-bought perms will likely still have to be bought again, or won off the prize wheel if that's the case.</p>

						 <p>A while back, there was a news update on the BVS front page that read:</p> <p>"More Things Loop: Everyone pretty much just dumps their stuff in the Storehouse before looping, and picks it why. Why bother, we say. Lots more stuff now Loops, and it will tell you what *doesn't* loop."</p> <p>This seems to suggest that items such as Ninja Dogs, Ninja Puppets, and Giant Fans now loop, but I've not seen anything to clarify this. My question, has anyone verified which items loop now that did not before, or can anyone decipher what "it will tell you what *doesn't* loop" means?</p> <p>Edit: Nevermind. I guess I'll just test it to find out which, if any, new permanent items loop.</p>
