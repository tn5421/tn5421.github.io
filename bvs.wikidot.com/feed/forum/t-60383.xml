						 <p>The Bird Village is recruiting Ninja!<br /> We are a growing village in the NWW, with many dedicated Ninja and a good attack/defense strategy. We do not have an NRF, but we do have a Party House, +50 chakra per charge, are in the NWW, a Jonin Council, and have an official village forum. Very soon, we will also have a Potion Palace, and many other upgrades.<br /> We have a few allies and are growing very fast. The more people we have, the stronger we will get. The sky is never the limit.</p> <p>Note: I am not the kage. MisaTange is our Kage, a dedicated BvS player and currently Season 2.<br /> I am Atama, a current Sp. Jonin and a member of the Village. Thanks for taking the time to read our ad, and good luck in whatever path you take.</p>
