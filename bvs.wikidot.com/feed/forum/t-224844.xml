						 <p>Well, I can read this question one of two ways, but the answer to both of them is 'yes, but it doesn't matter'.</p> <p>1) There is a hard cap to how many of one perm you can have (i.e. Ninja Dogs). This is a computer game, there's a hard cap to every value. However McM has said that the cap should be so high that you'll never hit it.</p> <p>2) There is a soft cap to how may different perms you have. By soft cap, I mean that the value fluctuates depending on how much free storage space the server has available. Once again McM said that the cap is so high that you'll never hit it, even if every character has every permanent item (long before it ever becomes a problem, McM will most likely upgrade his server, as that will mean many many more players and most likely many many more BC accounts).</p>

						 <p>kind vague in the questionâ€¦ most permanents don't stack in effects. however I've seen players with 225 permanent items in their player info. (and it only counts items once) and there are still items that haven't been found in game.</p>
