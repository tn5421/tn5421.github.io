						 <p>I ran into this really weird glitch, and I'm wondering if it's just me or something.</p> <p>I logged in a minute ago, to check my village and stuff(I had no more stamina), and it said "billy club" right under my name. I when to my village and went back, still there. I had no affect from it(Like I never ad it), but it was there, right in front of me. So I logged off and logged back on, and it wasn't there o.O</p> <p>Did this happen to anyone else? And what could of caused this?</p>
