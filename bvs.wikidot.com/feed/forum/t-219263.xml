						 <p>The Kage of our village, one who never seemed to do much in the way of coordination or attempting to grow, recently left. Now, under a new and much more active leader, 'The Fallen Village' is searching for active members to help bring us out of the shadows and onto the top. We welcome new players and extend open arms to anyone that wishes to join us. With 78 upgrades, we have much to offer any new members and seek to grow even more.</p>
