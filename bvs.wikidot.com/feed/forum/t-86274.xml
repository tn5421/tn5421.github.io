						 <p>+30 players and now Burger Ninja, not to mention all the Kaiju :-)</p> <p>Spare Kaiju drops are awared on a points basis, special VIP point for each drop donated to the village. 1 VIP point = 1 Kaiju drop</p> <p>All activity is tracked and everything with the accounting is clear and transparent. Also reserve stock of rare items to help out villagers when they are in need.</p> <p>We did have weekly prizes, but know Kaiju are here thats stopped. Any rare, non drop, items donated are given to the hardworking and needy :)</p>

						 <p>This we we bought the NRF upgrade, the Ninja cookery school (so Ramen on the Village page), and got an Enticement Altat.</p> <p>So we are now having fun fighting lots of Kaiju.</p> <p>Once we have lowerd our cost its Burger Ninja next, may be 5 days time as everyone is Kaiju fighting and not erning taxies :(</p> <p>We have a fair points system for the extra drop. So if you really want something just work hard for the village (Spy, invade, Kaiju fight, etc) earn the points and you will get it. :)</p>
