						 <p>I missed that possibility, nice catch … although it actually doesn't change the answer, as they end up lapping each other at the starting line anyway.</p>

						 <p>It's still really easy. K-Dog is runs one lap every 15 secs, Billy every 20 secs, and Spot every 30 secs. So every 15 secs K-Dog is at the start/finish line, Billy every 20, Spot every 30…so what's the lowest common multiple? It's 60 seconds so that's when they will all be lined up again.</p>

						 <p>Not necessarily completing a lap at the same time…it's when they are all lined up again, it didn't say where. For example, say they start at the 6&nbsp;o' clock position. they might be lined up at 3&nbsp;o' clock, or any other position. I think this is where the picture comes in. If it were just based on laps, it's be an easy math problem, but the added dimension of the circle makes it much harder.</p>

						 <p>Figure out how many seconds it takes for each of them to do a lap, and see if that helps … or even how many minutes per lap. See when they're all done a lap at the same time. Alternatively, just guess … it should only take a few weeks if you start at 1.</p>

						 <p>Has anyone figured out the answer to the alternate batman puzzle its:</p> <p>Okay, the next prize comes from the Batman: Gotham Knight Scavenger Hunt. It is over, but here's a puzzle so you can get the item anyway.</p> <p>K-Dog, Billy, and Spot all line up at the front of the village, and start running at the same time, in the same direction, around and around the village. K-Dog takes can run around the village four times a minute. Billy can run around the village three times a minute, and Spot can run around the village two times a minute. how many SECONDS will it take before they all are lined up together again.</p> <p>i tried and cant figure it out</p>
