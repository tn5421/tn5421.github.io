						 <p>Craziest thing that happened to me:</p> <p>I play the party house wheel usually 5 times each day, so one day I went in to play and the prize was a Stealth Suit.</p> <p>So I played, and the very first time I did it. I won a Stealth Suit. Needless to say, I was pretty happy about that.</p> <p>Then, I played it again. Another Stealth Suit. I actually thought something had glitched because I didn't think that could happen.</p> <p>So I played it again. A Ninja Puppet, which I already had, but I could at least sell it for a nice sum.</p> <p>I played it twice more like I normally do, but I didn't really get anything worthwhile after that. Still, two Stealth Suits and a Ninja Puppet is nothing to scoff at, so it was a good day, I guess.</p>

						 <p>Luckiest would have to be my Sannin run… The day before the announcment that it was changed to top 3 instead of top 1 I was telling my fellow villagers that it wasn't worth it and that I would loop the following day but then bam the announcment comes up and I decide I can take top 3. I was very under stocked with 9 hair pin peices and only 20k and then the hairpins loops were stopped and I was again in the race… Now the best part the day before I was going for my top 3 run the bug happens and we get free sannin yay for me.</p> <p>craziest would be 300 stamina worth of referals in one day and none of them have gotten to Chuunin or played the game</p>

						 <p>My village had been trying to get this one upgrade (Potion Palace, I think) for two weeks, but every time we got an advanced resource, we would get raided and it would get swiped before we logged on.</p> <p>I was doing some something else (probably working on the calculator) when day roll came around. Figuring "why not?", I logged in and played my game. At the end of my stamina, I noticed that we had just enough stuff for the Potion Palace. I bought it, and the five minutes later we got raided.</p>

						 <p>I just made an alt today because there were a few things I had wanted to test out with the way the system is right now.</p> <p>After having earlier today on my main character gotten The Rack without having won any Super Rares, my alt gets K-Dog's Headband on it's third try…. *kicks the Prize Wheel*</p>

						 <p>Well, that happened with my alternative character Madayo at the Prize Wheel. I got two Stealth Suits in a row. Shame though, K-Dogs Headband would've been much better.</p>

						 <p>My first roll on the slots I got enough money to roll again and so on until I won the sevens trophy. It was a 100 thousand win for 3000 ryo. I was really happy and thought it would be easy to win with my other characters I was so wrong.</p>

						 <p>Yesterday, I seriously lucked out … my VERY FIRST A-rank mission, I picked up Billy's level 3 mission. I had to wait to today to switch teams about, but then I went and did the mission (using a powerful potion and pervert-destroying punch, and even so, I only JUST had the range I needed) figuring I had a 1 in 4 chance of even succeeding in the mission. I managed EXACTLY the number of successes needed, and levelled up Billy to level 3!</p> <p>Of course, now this means I don't have the great level 2 teams that Billy gives … I suppose there's nothing for it but to level Emosuke too!</p>
