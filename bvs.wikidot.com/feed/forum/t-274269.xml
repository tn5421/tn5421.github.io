						 <p>Althoe this is going to change in a few days, the method right now is, At least 20 people UNLESS your village is over 40 then its 50% rounded UP so 49 people need 25 to unbingo (Up to 25 people) but in a few days the method to get ninpo mask will be take off 111 hours in one season, easier in the sense you can take your time, MUCH harder in the sense it can't be done in a single day anymore. 3+days min if we understand it correctly.</p>

						 <p>"The lowest amount of villagers needed to be bingo'd to get this trophy is 20. So the village size has to be atleast 40."</p> <p>This is wrong. You have to have at least 20 villagers. You need at least 20 bingo'd or 50% village, whichever is greater. If you have less than 40 villagers you have to have at least 20 bingo'd.</p>
