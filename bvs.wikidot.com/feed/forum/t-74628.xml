						 <p>It has never happened to me in two seasons of playing, but then again the RNG hates me (and you, and your family, and your little dog to) with a cold pure passion that can shatter starlight and cool planetary cores.</p>

						 <p>so does that mean there's a chance of getting two of the item if it's an item for example?</p> <p>like if your on 'find medicinal herbs' is there a chance of getting one from spot as well as one from the normal stuff?</p>

						 <p>It's not that complicated. You have your normal chance to get an item (affected by themes, jutsu, ramen, pokeballs, etc), and then after that check is over with, Spot gives another 10% chance, completely independent from the first.</p> <p>It's just like it says in his ally description: Gives you a second, additional 10% chance to find hidden items and Ninja.</p>

					<![CDATA[
						 <p>it says that you get a SECONDARY 10% bonus to finding hidden items and ninja, what does this mean?<br /> how is this different to a normal 10% increase?</p> <p>does it mean that if before spot there is a 95% chance of getting something, after getting him there is still a chance it wont work? also, does whiteeye and stand by your ninja double spots bonus as well?</p> <p>p.s., i think the details of what it means by secondary should be added to his page.</p>
