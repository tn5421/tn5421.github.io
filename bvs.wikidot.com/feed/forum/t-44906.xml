						 <p>This forum is to help people find sparring partners. Here is how this forum should be used.</p> <ol> <li>Create a new post with your character's name in it. You may also include some text like "Seeking sparring partners," but your character's name must be in the original title!</li> <li>Only 1 character per thread, just to make it easier to track.</li> <li>People should reply to existing threads with a request to be added. Only request to be added to the thread maker's lists in that thread.</li> <li>The thread maker should edit his/her post whenever people have been added to their list.</li> <li>Bumping is permitted, but only if your post is at least 10 posts down from the top <em>and</em> it has not received a reply in 48 hours.</li> <li>Don't post in someone's thread unless you've <em>already</em> added them for sparring. Posting in 3+ people's threads and then logging off for the night is kind of rude.</li> </ol> <p>Excess posts will be deleted by the moderators. Chatting should occur in other forums, this one is for a highly specialized purpose. Too much clutter and it loses it's value.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p>
