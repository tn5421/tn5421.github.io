						 <p>The village has four players now. Once we have a fifth, I already have all the ryo and resources lined up to get us our next upgrade and set us well on the path our next. Then it's just a matter of pushing the size up to ten. Then do the collection game for a bit, and bam, in the war. ^_^</p> <p>[edit]: Alright, we lost a player because they decided they didnt want to play anymore. *sigh*</p>

						 <p>I didnt want to set anything to rigidly until I had a better idea of what people want, so it's a bit of a two way street there … people will join because the ideal appeals to them.</p> <p>The one idea to me that I have very strong desire to put forward is I want the village to be the elite. Not maybe in the numbers because those change and season rolls happen. But I want people who know what the heck they're doing. <strong>The overall idea is I want people the village can be proud of, and I want the village to be something everyone can be proud of.</strong> Everything else is window dressing.</p> <p>So then, I suppose the question is what you would want to happen there, because Im pretty open to ideas at this point.</p>

						 <p>Working on my player page, though I don't expect I'll write myself a background the way you did.</p> <p>About the village: I'll be applying in a day or two or something, whatever the minimum wait time is after leaving your village. However, I'm still unclear, what's the village's overall ethos? No offense, but a village with the sole purpose of being one person's whatever doesn't strike me with much allure.</p>

						 <p>OOCly, the idea of the village is to have fun. To me having fun is devising these little stories and interactions of roleplay. Its a browser game, and therefore I'm not going to expect epic-quality stuff (not going to turn it down though!) That is however, what I'm aiming for.</p> <p>ICly, Serene village is named that because it's Rudha's escape. I had little fun being constantly bingolocked because some idiot decided to pick a fight with the wrong village alliance in my old village, not to mention the high tax of a large village, and so she left to create her own little village.</p>

						 <p>Alright, well I'm only a few (three) levels short of my Jonin exam and the village I'm in <em>presently</em> is equipped with a Jonin council. After I make Jonin however I'd be more than willing to join up with your village, it sounds like a good deal of fun and interaction.</p> <p>Now, you spoke of roleplay which I am completely in favor of… but perhaps you'd give me some guidelines as to what you had in mind? Is there a general mission statement to the village, a goal or ethos perhaps?</p>

						 <p>We have all the upgrades we can have with three villagers, which is admittedly not much. Trying to push it up to the next bracket to get more upgrades. I've not had a problem getting resources or money — its people that are being a bit of a limiting resource -_-</p>

						 <p>Giving this thread a gentle bump. We have all the upgrades we can get at our current size, so if anyone is interested in joining it would be well received and appreciated as it would put us in our next 'size' bracket.</p>

						 <p>I have to stress that this is a new and small village, just made — so that offers both the benefit of getting a place leading the village if you prove trustworthy, but also means we dont have much for upgrades and storehouse et cetera.</p> <p>If that doesn't dissuade you though, feel free to apply, and I will admit you. Up to a certain size (I'm think 25/30) I'm pretty willing to give people who have an interesting character a chance, after that is when I plan to get a lot more picky — because I don't want the village too big (upkeep is a pain, also solidarity and scattered outposts give some nice bonuses I'd like to procure)</p>

						 <p>Heya. I'd love to join on my main account, Gokudera. The account is heavily based on the character of the same name from Katekyo Hitman REBORN! and is at Jounin level, so I'll be able to patrol daily. I ended up losing my main computer a while back, so he became inactive and got kicked from his old village. XD Thanks ahead of time though~</p>

						 <p>Hey there, as some of you mighta taken note of, I was in NerdFury village for a while, but I found the tax, and the slow rate of resources/gold they were getting frustrating, so I've gone and created my own village, Serene Village.</p> <p>To make this post short and sweet I have three things:</p> <ol> <li>If anyone is interested in joining and helping out a new, small village, I would be happy to have you. I would rather have people who have some sort of roleplay to them, neednt be a novel, it's just a webgame, but something. Post here and I'll see if I can get to you. Seeing whereas high tax is something I would like to avoid, please understand I might not induct everyone that applies.</li> <li>I'd be interested in cooperating with the village you guys here have, if you guys want.</li> <li>If anyone can offer advice for starting out a village, I would be appreciative.</li> </ol> <p>Thanks, <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/player:rudha">Rudha</a>.</p>
