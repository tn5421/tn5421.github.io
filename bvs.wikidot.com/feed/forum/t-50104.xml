						 <p>Shinogobmi village is a village created and run by Nurute.<br /> It's a really small village with lots of resources and Ryo. However, we're really short on members. Once having 5 members (and getting all related upgrades), we are down to 2 active members (2 left for Sp.Jonin) and we REALLY need new members. Please join and help this village grow!</p> <p>PS: Uzuki, If we're in the war (need members first tough) want to have an alliance?</p>
