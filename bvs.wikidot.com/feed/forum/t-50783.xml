						 <p>Or we can do that! Even invading for solid fires requires more coordination. We need to know where the fires are (requiring a Spy Network) and hope that there are 3 available when we have 3 ice, and that we don't get hit from the time we break peace to the time we get all the fires. We also have to hope those 3 villages are out of peace and reasonably attackable.</p> <p>It'd still require attacking 3 times in one day (rotating timespheres and trophaeum tower would facilitate this). As an aside, this may also end up pissing off villages and encouraging sabotage attacks against us.</p> <p>Invading is viable, but it's a less surefire way than resource trading.</p>

						 <p>Epic Monument takes a little more coordination, since we need to have 4 resources and 2 other villages to trade with who produce fire.</p>

						 <p>Since we got our NRF, we have a 10% chance per day to get a monster as a passive ability. This only happens when we're not currently fighting a monster. If we get an Enticement Altar, we can summon one for 8 resources whenever we want.</p> <p>A lot of Villages I've talked to set a day of the week to do their monster summon, so people can plan around it.</p>

						 <p>I can't wait to fight monsters :) Are they around all the time though? While I love the idea of getting monster goodies if they are always attacking us would sorta take away time from doing other things. Or is it like a 1/week or 1/month or something? No idea :) Never seen a monster invasion before</p>

						 <p>We got peacetime until we have the resources. That's the thing about peacetime, you can do it long enough that there's literally nothing an opponent can do to get past the defenses.</p>

						 <p>Just how high of a peacetime will we go for before trading? Hopefully none of our enemies read this plan on our forum and decide to hit us with Ashen Warpaint.</p>

						 <p>Bingo'ing doesn't break peacetime, so bingo away. Once I start the peacetime, I'll disable spying and raiding for everyone in the village until we're ready to break peacetime.</p>

					<![CDATA[
						 <p>Upgrade #16 is going to be an <a href="http://bvs.wikidot.com/upgrade:enticement-altar">Enticement Altar</a>.</p> <p>Here's the deal. We need a way to dump basic resources that doesn't cost ryo, and an enticement altar will let us dump basic resources to summon monsters. Monsters mean cheap village upgrades and the chance for really sweet permanent items for the villagers. It's definitely one of the best upgrades available for an NRF village.</p> <p>To facilitate this, I've arranged for an advanced resource exchange with another village. When we have the ryo, we're going to go peace time and wait until we have 2 ice. Once we've got 2 ice, we break peace time and invade our ally's village for 1 fire, they invade ours for 1 ice. We both buy our enticement altar immediately.</p> <p>Since this kind of exchange requires timing and coordination beyond just our own village, I'm not putting this one up for a vote. We'll return to voting for upgrades after Upgrade #16. (Upgrade 14 and 15 will proceed as normal, voting is still open for those!)</p>
