						 <p>Update: We are now summoning many kaiju to the village, currently we are enticing about 2-3 kaiju per week so if anyone needs a kaiju drop you can try your luck in the village. We also have the essential upgrades(Epic Monument, Jonin council, Burgerninja and Tools of the Trade) and they are open to anyone who needs them.</p>

						 <p>We need more members, we have 20 now but we need more to further expand. We have mostly member upgrades, I like to focus on helping the members more than the village currently. We have a party house, Jonin council, and a war room. Our next upgrade is the potion palace :) If you want to join, then feel free to send an application :)</p>
