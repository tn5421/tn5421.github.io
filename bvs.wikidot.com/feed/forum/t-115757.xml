						 <p>wow……as far as i have heard he gives this item or some item for bingoing his character. If you state the item or his name you get banned. Something like this…..wow. Its not on the list because of this reason….Iv met him multiple times and he has talked to most people in the game. Almost 200 probably and alot more. I know of 200. He has talked to me over 30 times.</p>

						 <p>I've been waiting for a character to be deleted since November, and I said that in the BvS Chat.</p> <p>the 11DBHK suddenly floated into the chat and started talking, so I just said merry christmas, and asked him how stuff was going, and he read back some of the chat, saw that I was waiting to delete a character, and then he asked me what the name was gonna be. I told him, and he said that I could make it, and after I did, he gave me the mark.</p> <p>He also gave it to a guy named sikcool1, so you can ask him as well if you want.</p>

						 <p>Why did you delete your character now?</p> <p>and,as lucinthus says,where/when/how did he contact you as it may be the first method so far of contacting him other than the info he gave out for the charity thingy.</p>

						 <p>Yes, because the 11DBHK saw that I was waiting for a char to be deleted, so he said I could make a new one, and when I did, he gave me the item.</p>

						 <p>I'm sure that this item exists before. I don't know if someone erased it from the items list. A couple of guys got it from fighting the 11dbhk in the arena, when he use to play the game.</p>
