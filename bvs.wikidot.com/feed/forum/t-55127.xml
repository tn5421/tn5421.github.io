						 <p>Actually, why don't we hold off on the kaiju until Friday then. I don't think it'll be a problem, but some have indicated that Thursday's not optimal, and we'll have more Sannin back on Friday.</p>

						 <p>Summoning via the enticement altar is instant. The moment I trigger it, we have the monster. We didn't have a random attack at all today, both were summoned.</p> <p>I usually try and do a summon (if I'm going to do a summon) at the beginning of the day (immediately after dayroll). Our Crazed Mimiga today were done right at day roll. They had been killed in about 7 hours I think? The monkeys were summoned right after the Mimiga died.</p> <p>I did two today (and probably will do two tomorrow) because it's possible to get through the the little ones very quickly (especially with this many Sannin).</p> <p>Chance of getting a fox or demon is relatively small (probably 1 in 26 or something like that), and they do regenerate. But I'm not overly worried about them. Even if they do get a day's regen in, we'll just kill them the next day as things stand right now.</p> <p>Did that answer your concerns?</p>

					<![CDATA[
						 <p>@BvS-Uzuki</p> <p>About Kaiju: How summoning works?</p> <p>Today I was rather early and monster was already there and second monster was summoned after killing first and it was there right away.</p> <p>Summoning is instantaneous or first of the day is summoned at next dayroll?</p> <p>Or this was case of random monster attack?</p> <p>If summoning is instantaneous maybe you should summon kaiju for early players to fight. (Like me)</p> <p>Problem would be Diff rising monsters. But with as many sannin not much.</p> <p>What is possibility of summoning a Fox or Sand demon? And are they regenerating or rising hp?(Hp could be over starting point)</p>

						 <p>It's a lottery. Just like the new party house game except you spend Stamina (and maybe Chakra) instead of Ryo. Every attack that does damage counts as one ticket (except for maybe the Kage. I know that my kage has never gotten two items from one monster, but that doesn't mean anything). After the Kaiju is defeted, the tickets are all pooled and then one is drawn. If it has your name on it, congratulations. You have earned my <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">hate</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">envy</span> hate.</p>

						 <p>I beg to disagree. The first monster that attacked our village gave its monster drop to a villager who only attacked once.</p>

						 <p>actually I am pretty sure that damage has nothing to do with it. Only attacks.</p>

						 <p>From what was explained to me it works like that:</p> <p>Each attack gives you higher chance to get monser drop. Higher Hp damage done to monster is also included into this and make probability higher.</p> <p>But higher probability don't make it sure thing. My alt made 14 attacks(I really wanted item) and made hundreds hp damage and drop went to guy that attack 3 times and probably didn't make much hp damage with him being chunnin.</p>

						 <p>ahh ok… I just asked cause the last 3, I think it was 3, Kaiju that attacked Alt Village always dropped the Item on top of the one unfortunate soul that got the most attacks on that day (well I really asked because in all the time I'm in that Village I never got a monster Item *cries*)</p>

						 <p>It's still random. Whenever a kaiju dies, the kage gets 1 item, and then a second item (of the same kind) is raffled off. Each attack where you did damage gets you 1 ticket. So, it's randomly distributed amongst those who did damage, with the person who did the most damage having the highest chance of getting it.</p> <p>If the Kage already has the item, he can give it to whoever he wants. Often, this is the person who's got the most attacks.</p>

					<![CDATA[
						 <p>So am I getting this right in assuming that when you kill a Kaiju the only person who gets an item is the one with the most attacks? Wasn't this random before? because now I think I will never get a monster Item (well except for the new lottery….. well no I won't get one there either)</p>
