						 <p>You can check how many tickets have been played the day before. Mostly on Golden Collar of xxx (+1 range in 1 stat) about 16&nbsp;000-20&nbsp;000 tickets are played. Strength or level items are about the half and Polar Star and regalia are played in about 40&nbsp;000-50&nbsp;000 tickets. So you if u want to be 99% sure you have to be the appropriate amount of tickets.</p>

						 <p>It is based more on luck. Think of it like the lottery in real life. The more tickets you have the better, but only one is chosen to win. The more tickets you have, the better your chance of winning it, but just having many tickets does not guarantee you will get the item.</p>

						 <p>Let's say I want to win an item from the raffle; however though do you win an item based on pure luck or whoever has the most tickets? If it's pure number of tickets, then how many would say you would need to win one of the items? Thanks in advance.</p>
