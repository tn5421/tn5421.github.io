						 <p>It used to be, before the Recode, that Villagers could learn Jutsu from regular Allies that other Villagers had, even if they themselves didn't have that Ally. So if you and I were in the same village and you had Z-Dog but I didn't, I could still learn Z-Dog's jutsu, only at a +50% JXP penalty.</p> <p>This made it too easy to get certain Jutsu, like Epic Dog Urination and Bring Down the House, and it was removed.</p>

						 <p>I may not be a Kage (…wait, in BvS wasn't it changed to Cage for "teh luls"? I'm not sure why everyone else still says "Kage" when meaning in BvS…)<br /> but I was looking through the village pages.<br /> What is the "trainers" section? How does a village get them, what do they do, are they not actually in BvS just something the Cages put in their pages for fun?<br /> Give me some help here please ^^</p>
