						 <p>You're being silly. She isn't doing a dramatic reveal type thing, it's that for the first two iterations it was assumed she was simply a reference to Inoue Orihime. Robogirl Lv. 3 reveals that it was not Inoue but, in fact, Shirley that she was parodying, with some flavour from Orihime thrown in as pun-ishment.</p>

						 <p>Why is the trivia text written that way? Robogirl &quot;reveals&quot; that she's based off Shirley? uhh, no, she simply IS based off shirley. Similar to the r00t character swaps, it wouldn't sound right to make it sound like throughout the reaper/mono mission,s we've been travelling with Shirley all along. maybe i'm being technical or something, but just doesn't sound right. Oh, and the chracter photo has nails in her neck.</p>

						 <p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure this is based on Shirley from Code Geass.</p>
