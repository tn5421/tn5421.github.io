						 <p>Ok, so I tried to add my new-ish village to the wiki, but it says I'm not a member, and when I tried to apply, it said I already sent an application… Lord knows how long that application has been floating around, I've been playing since April 26 of last year, so I was wondering how much more I'm going to have to wait…</p> <p>EDIT: Nevermind. You can delete this thread.</p>
