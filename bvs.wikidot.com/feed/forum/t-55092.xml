						 <p>New Monochrome Special Mission-<br /> The Dark Hour<br /> Miss Kitty tells you of a time within time!<br /> Look For It &gt;</p> <p>Taijutsu</p> <p>Focus!</p> <p>You look at your watch - the time is approaching. What happens?</p> <p>Difficulty: 20 Successes: 20</p> <p>Fail. Nothing happens. Did you miss it?</p> <p>Jgirl note: these are really hard to do- better use the -30 stam jutsu for all of them, and have permanent item boosts.</p> <p>Success! The world goes dark for a split second, and the place bursts into motion!</p> <p>Genjutsu</p> <p>Defend!</p> <p>Your classmates, in this moment out of time, draw arcane weapons and attack each other! Survive!</p> <p>Difficulty: 20 Successes: 20</p> <p>Success! You manage to dodge, as you become accustomed to this new dimension!</p> <p>Ninjutsu</p> <p>React</p> <p>During the melee, a deadly flash goes for your neck!</p> <p>Difficulty: 20 Successes: 20</p> <p>Fail. Your spiritual hard rolls from your shoulders, and you flash back to the real world.</p> <p>Jgirl note: hard? not head?</p> <p>Success! You backflip away, surviving by a hair's breadth!</p> <p>You look upon your attack.. and you hear a 'sip-p-p-p' he smiles evilly, flipping his hair and drinking a cup of ghostly tea.</p> <p>It is Mister Tea!</p> <p>"You thought me dead? No. I am not dead."</p> <p>"I am Free."</p> <p>"Free of the shackles of Pants. Free to be as I desire. Free to revel in No Pants Day. I have ripped them from my soul. I am immortal. I am Pantsless."</p> <p>You step back, as the rest of the assembled crowd cowers from his power. "Join me," he says. "Remove your Pants, and become more powerful than you've ever imagined."</p> <p>Before you can reply, the Dark Hour ends, and everyone snaps back to their bodies, and the world continues on. A remnant of the world within this world - the Dark Hour - stays with you.</p> <p>You got The Dark Band!</p> <p>Jgirl note- OH NOES EVIL MR TEA!</p>

						 <p>Also- A note- I obviously have Miss Kitty, but I have yet to see "The Secret" so perhaps Robogirl 2 is also required for that.<br /> It kinda makes sense if you read the mission texts about her being all "city-destroying mode" or whichever it was.</p>
