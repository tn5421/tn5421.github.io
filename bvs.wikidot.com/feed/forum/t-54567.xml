						 <p>It's a reference to the Impossible Mission.</p> <p>After you get Billy 3 and Emosuke 3, and put them in a team, you unlock the impossible mission. The requirements are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Sannin in all 3 bloodlines as a theme (so loop as Sannin in each bloodline)</li> <li>Seal the Nine Tailed Fox and the Demon of Sand as a theme (loop after your village has killed each of these 2 kaiju, you only get the item as kage, but can be traded)</li> <li>Get the Note and the Tote</li> <li>Get Bankai and Cobrakai</li> <li>Be a kage of an epic village (has an epic monument) with 50 people</li> </ul> <p>No one knows what comes after this. The only person close to beating this is EvilTaxi, who has themes for Sannin in all 3 bloodlines, and sealed the Demon of Sand and Nine Tails. This season he needs to get the Note, the Tote, Bankai, and Cobrakai. He's already a kage of an epic village (and won't have much trouble getting 50 people).</p>

						 <p>I know that, before looping was implemented, it was said that getting to Sanin and sealing either the fox or the sand demon was as close to 'winning the game' as you could get.</p> <p>I never received clarification as to what that statement meant.</p>

						 <p>Most of us think that it means you do double damage to kaiju. You don't need to be a Sannin to seal the Sand Demon or the Nine-Tailed Fox.</p>

						 <p>When you become sannin it says something about sealing or maybe containing itâ€¦. So whats that mean? does it mean you get something about the 1 and 9 tailed kaiju?</p>
