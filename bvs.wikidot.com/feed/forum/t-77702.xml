						 <blockquote> <p>No need to do THAT again, amirite?"</p> </blockquote> <p>That seems to suggest that the shortened 3 day timer is only for those who already have completed the mission in a previous Season. I'd assume Season 1 is unchanged. It might be unchanged for Season 2 players who never completed the mission as well.</p>

						 <p>i just did over the edge again and now it's only 1 day (24 hours) to do it, not three, but i think this is either only for S2+ or for S3+ (since i'm season three)<br /> last season when i done it it was 3 days but it may have been changed since then.</p> <p>anyway, heres the text:</p> <p>Three-ish Days of Training</p> <p>"You have to train down there for three straight- oh, it is you."<br /> He tosses you a candy. Ooh, delicious candy! You eat it (of course).</p> <p>"That'll cut the three-day timer down to one day. No need to do THAT again, amirite?"</p> <p>(If you abandon this mission, or continue this mission, before one full day - 24 hours - have passed from the time you read this text right here. you will fail. You can do other things, but not anything regarding this or any other special mission. So, start a one-day timer right now, and come back in one day!)</p> <p>someone add it/ update/ whatever please.</p>
