						 <p>To bingo someone you first have to track them. The difficulty of tracking someone is determined by the difference in your levels multiplied by two. Successes needed is three, by default.</p> <p>Ex. You're level 50, the target is level 20. 50 - 20 = 30. 30 x 2 = 60. The tracking portion is 60 Difficulty, 3 Successes. Literally impossible unless you use Hyuk's jutsu to auto-track.<br /> Ex2. You're level 50, the target is level 45. 50 - 45 = 5. 5 x 2 = 10. The tracking is 10 Difficulty, 3 Successes.</p> <p>Once you successfully track them, you go onto the actual bingo, which is like a kind of battle. Both you and your target get HP (variable, depending on the size of their village, themes, etc), first to 0 hp loses and is bingo'd. You can also use a notepage for an instant kill (unless they're using Tools of the Trade, a specific theme, or have a decent peacetime bonus).</p>

						 <p>You need to attack someone near your level. The greater the distance (above or below) that they are from you the more difficulty they have. Once you have Hyuk (200 style points) you can learn a Jutsu for 100sta that lets you succeed on anyone for tracking.</p>
