						 <p>I sincerely doubt that the silver coin has that much of a variable in price. Today, Sunday, October 19, 2008, all traessure items I am aware of were pushed up to the maximum price seen (beating the record value on the number of pages). This was likely in celebration of the new money sink of a party game.</p> <p>However, the silver coin was set to 200 ryo today, far below the max price listed on the page. I think there may have been a mix up when the price was listed as such, possibly confused with another item.</p>
