						 <p>The page of Reaper Menu is supposed to have all 4 Reaper Blood images, but only has one, Cobra Kai, because the other three link to non-existent files.<br /> If someone could please go in and remove the number 2 from directly before the .jpg in all three of the other file names, they would work properly.<br /> I would go in and do so myself, but my current character has not been active long enough for me to join and edit.<br /> Example:<br /> Reaper_Blood_-_Dormant2.jpg<br /> should just be<br /> Reaper_Blood_-_Dormant.jpg</p> <p>The Cobrai Kai image has a 2 in the name, but that file exists— I assume someone tried to change all 4, not realizing only one of them was named that way.<br /> Thanks much!<br /> —Ariamaki</p>
