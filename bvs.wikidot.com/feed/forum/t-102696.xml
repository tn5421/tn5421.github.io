						 <p>In S1-S3, my experience was that I had the level I needed to do any exam by the time I needed to take the exam. That is, when I hit Chunin, just by focusing on getting 3 lvl. 2 allies, doing some initial reaper stuff and trade stuff, I managed to get the levels I needed for the Sp. Jonin exam. Then, as a Sp. Jonin, doing Reaper, Wasteland, Trade, and more Lvl. 2's, I found I had the levels I needed before taking the Jonin exam. Those are the only times you need to rush levels (unless you're trying to rush to loop).</p> <p>So, to turn on Out on Top, you need to turn off the theme that doubles your chance of leveling allies. Generally speaking, the amount of times you'll need to do that is quite small.</p>

						 <p>no Uzuki is right the only use for Out On Top theme would be trying to get thro a season as quickly as you can , and P.S Uzuki would get alot more use out of it then a new guy since he can level to what are you season 5 Uzuki so he can level to around Level 114</p>

						 <p>Out on top is actually a useless theme. There's no reason to get it unless you're just being obsessive.</p>

						 <p>certain things give you different items depending on what starting bloodline you have when you do it, plus Whiteeye gets a lot less useful in S2+ once you have Stand By Your Ninja.</p>

						 <p>oh and note sure you can always just wait untill next season to do anything but lets just say you need to finish WasteLand with all 3 starter bloodlines so you need to change bloodlines each season and finish it 3 times atleast so sooner is better</p>

						 <p>There is nothing that you cant do later on. Some things require season 2+ or 3+, but nothing requires being in a certain season.</p>
