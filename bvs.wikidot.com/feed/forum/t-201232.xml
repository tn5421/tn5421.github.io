						 <p>It might be a vague reference to the video games of the same title (on Sony Playstation systems). In which you fight or capture monsters. The games haven't gotten much attention in America, but they are suppose to be really popular in Japan.<br /> I could think of a few possible choices for the trophy title that the developer didn't choose: such as monster slayer, killer, etcâ€¦ Or possibly even switch the monster part out for something like Kaiju Hunter.<br /> By choosing those two specific words togther, it makes it seem more believable that it is probably a reference to the Monster Hunter video game series.</p>
