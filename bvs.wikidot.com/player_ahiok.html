<p>Name: Ahiok<br />
Name Meaning: The Great One, Greatness, or Pwnge<br />
Type: Vizard<br />
Seat: 3rd<br />
Attributes<br />
Strength: High<br />
Kidou: Above-average<br />
Reiatsu: High<br />
Speed: Fast as the Wind~</p>
<p>Zanpakuto's Name<br />
Kaze'ryu (Wind Dragon)</p>
<p><strong>Shikai</strong><br />
Release Command: Suraisu (Slice)<br />
When my blade releases, it lengthens slightly. Along with the release my Reiatsu increases my speed and strength. Using my Shikai allows me to shoot blades of wind by swinging my blade, the range of these are not very long, but they are quite useful in a short range fight. The wind blades cut through almost anything, and are very useful when my blade meets an opponents blade as I can pump Reiatsu to inflict minor wounds on my opponents as our blades are locked together.</p>
<p><strong>Bankai</strong><br />
Bankai Name: Hoeru Kaze'ryu (lit howl wind dragon)<br />
Along with the release of my Bankai comes another increase in blade length, speed and strength. My speed is increased to the point where my regular moves are almost a Shunpo and my Shunpo is near untraceable. New moves that come with the release state is the ability to shoot arrows from my sword, which are stronger then the attacks of the wind blades along with being more focused and therefore easier to dodge. Slicing my sword and releasing arrows results in a wall of arrows which I can use to move an enemy where I want them to be and take advantages of openings they present. While in Bankai Kaze'ryu can physically manifest as a sky blue dragon that is invulnerable to conventional attacks. Kaze'ryu has similar abilities as me, and my main usage of him is to use him to catch an opponent off guard with attacks from the rear.</p>
<p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wind Blade: This ability is the main weapon allowed by my Shikai. Using my Reiatsu I can form blades of wind from my blade and attack from a slightly farther distance.</li>
<li>Slicing Wind: This ability is weaker then the basic wind blade, but is much the same in how it acts. I can channel this through my hands or feet and use it to inflict small wounds or distract my opponent.</li>
<li>Wind Control: This ability is basic wind control, that is strengthened when I release to Bankai. Main uses of this is to keep a situational awareness as I can feel movements in the air and to slightly effect attacks by redirecting them.</li>
<li>Cero: A Cero is a high powered energy blast that I can use when I tap into my Hollow side. The Cero requires a second or two to ready but is quite damaging and can be fired from anywhere on my body.</li>
<li>Bala: A Bala is a weak Cero that requires less energy and focus, but can be shot off quicker. Main uses of Bala is to overload an enemy with too many attacks to dodge.</li>
<li>Wind Affinity: Wind affinity is basically an extra strong wind control, while accessing my hollow powers I can use Wind Affinity to become one with the wind and vanish. Main uses include dodging attacks and sneak attacks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Suddenly finding myself in Rukongai, it was a battle to survive. Food was hard to come by, friends couldn't be trusted, sleep was uneasy and the land was harsh. Traveling from town to town I learned a few things about sword fighting, unarmed fighting and survival. The most important thing though, was learning about Seireitei. The promised land, no hunger, no backstabbing and best of all, knowledge. Knowledge was a powerful thing in the afterlife, knowledge of the life you had before could lead to insanity, knowledge about how to deal with everything would lead to a better future. That's what I was after, a future without hunger, a future without fear, and best of all, a future without worries. That day changed everything.</p>
<p>I started training, I started working, I was using less time fighting others, and more time reading. I read everything I could get my hands on (how I got it doesn't matter, stop asking) about Seireitei, becoming a Shinigami and how to use Reiatsu. I trained and I trained until one day I heard about a test, a test to see who from Rukongai was able to join the Shinigami Academy. The Shinigami Academy test was easier then anticipated, all they did was check your reiatsu levels and asked you a few questions, I would've been able to pass if I was blind. But this was it, I was on the road to a good life (afterlife?).</p>
<p>The Academy itself was a lot harder then the entrance exam. We were grilled on eveerything from Kidou and Swordsmanship to History and Current Earth Events. The classes were relentless and tiring, three hours of Kidou practice would be followed by four hours of sparing with blades and then we would have to sit through a two hour history class. I ended each day exhausted but feeling better then I ever remembered feeling, I knew I was at the top of the class, no one would get Kidou down as fast as me, I rarely lost in my spars and the Earth History classes came naturally to me, I had heard that the strongest of souls from Rukongai would gain their memories if they trained hard enough. So, my Academy days went smooth for the most part, there were the normal fights you would expect in a school ranging from everything starting at jealousy up to being envious, sometimes even for something as simple as looking at someone the wrong way. I hardly lost those fights and people learned to leave me alone soon enough.</p>
<p>The Academy Exam day arrived soon enough, the Exam started with a written portion which was easy enough and uneventful. Things changed once we hit the practical. The previous years had to simply demonstrate their abilities to the teachers to graduate, but for some reason our class was different. Be it a shortage of available Shinigami, or an excess of Hollow activity, we were sent out in squads of three to combat real Hollows. I was placed in charge of my cell, being the best I had two mediocre students at my back, the instructors pulled me aside to say I was going to graduate, that was a given, to be backup for the other guys. I agreed, he was my senior, who was I to argue. That was the worst decision I could have made.</p>
<p>As soon as we arrived at Earth, our portal to Seireitei snapped shut, something that should not have happened. I immediately had everyone on guard when I unsheathed my sword, despite there being no visible enemies or Reiatsu around, things just didn't feel right. Suddenly, I felt a powerful Reiatsu source, in my haste to dodge I didn't realize that my dodge would result in the death of a comrade. It was the first time I saw death grab a Shinigami, but it wouldn't be the last. The look of pain on his face showed it all, he felt betrayed by me for not protecting or shouting a warning, like it was my fault didn't react fast enough.</p>
<p>The other Shinigami in training managed to awaken from his stupor and get away from the beast. I joined him and told him to work on reopening the portal to Seireitei, I would hold off the beast, it was stronger then we were told it would be, easily out of a new Shingami's league, but me, being the cocky fool I was, believed I could handle it. I lunged at the beast and when it flared it's Reiatsu, I realized how bad of an idea it was. It stopped my attack with hardly any effort. Looking back I could see my companion was having no luck opening the portal, the beast's Reiatsu must have been preventing it. I knew then I had to distract the beast so my companion could escape, yelling as much to him, just telling him to run and keep running until he could reopen the portal, that I would hold it off until he could get a real Shinigami to back us up. He could see in my eyes that I fully expected to die, and protested his leaving, but only one of us would be able to hold it off long enough for the other to escape, otherwise we both would die along with the innocent souls that would be devoured before help arrived.</p>
<p>He ran, just like I told him to, and I hated him for it, though I would never admit it to the superiors. But another flare of Reiatsu brought me back to the fight, the beast had lunged at me and I barely had enough time to bring my blade up to block his attack, and that almost failed on me. I was thrown back, it hurt. A lot. I knew not enough time had passed so I managed to get back up and shot off the highest level Kidou I knew Level 33 Sokatsui, it barely stunned him. My strongest Kidou had failed me, even with the full chant, I knew nothing I could do would stop it, but I still had to fight. I shot off a Shitotsu Sansen to bind it, hopefully allow me to wound it, but when I hit the beast, it's skin stopped my blade and it broke free of the binding and hit me again, sending me into another wall.</p>
<p>Once again I managed to get to my feet and engage the beast, this time focusing on deflecting blows and avoiding them, as that seemed to be the best way to survive. For all my speed and training, I was still getting hit once every three or four attacks and not getting off any attacks of my own, time seemed endless and my foe just seemed to get more and more speed and strength. I still refused to give in and kept giving it my all until it pinned me, it had me against the wall and was going to finish me off, I just hoped that the backup made it pay with pain and didn't finish it quickly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, everything seemed to slow down and I heard a voice, barely a whisper on the wind saying to slice, slice with the fury of a wind dragon, move as one with the wind, become a force of nature. I listened, I yelled out, with every ounce of determination, willpower and anger I had &quot;SLICE, KAZE'RYU&quot;. And with a burst of energy, the Hollow was blown back and I felt renewed, I felt lighter then air and most importantly, I felt like I could actually beat this thing. I moved, faster then I had ever moved before and attacked, I felt my blade drop into the flesh of the beast and remove an appendage. I was ecstatic, I might actually survive, I might actually win!</p>
<p>From there, I let my battle instincts take over, the beast seemed slower and weaker, he seemed to not be able to swing his arms at me as accurately, the blows he did land were just glancing blows. Either way, the fight wasn't over, we were as near I could tell, an almost even match, but I gave it my all, I would pop off quick destruction spells at it, of a low level, mostly as a bother to it, but they seemed to be doing more damage now then the stronger one I had used earlier. I would occasionally bind it's arms to stop an attack or block, he was getting pushed back, but I felt my energy fading. I knew I would have to end it soon or be ended soon. With the fear gone, I remembered my classes, the only way to defeat a Hollow was to cleave it's mask in two, I knew I would have to go for it. Building as much energy as I could, I leaped and on the descent whipped my blade towards the Hollow's mask, he brought up an arm to block me, but I knew what to do, I released a burst of energy and a Wind Blade severed his arm allowing be to hit his mask. Now, I expected a great resistance when I hit the mask, but the Academy never mentions that a Hollow's mask is easily severed by a Zanpakuto. Once the Hollow's presence was gone, I felt another, and as I turned to defend myself another Hollow had easily batted me away, I lost my blade during the hit. Laid out, and seeing the Hollow approach, I knew I couldn't save myself this time.</p>
<p>As the Hollow brought it's sharp appendage towards my torso, I saw a blur. The Shinigami in training I had sent to fetch help was back and had blocked the Hollow's attack. He looked back at me and smirked, but he was too soon in his celebrations, the Hollow's other arm had pierced his body while he looked away, and the hollow simply tossed him to the side, but then the hollow was cleaved in two by the reinforcement he brought. Soon enough to save me, but not soon enough to save the others. As the Shinigami helped me to my feet I realized who it was, the guy that had pulled me to the side before, and he was not an instructor, he was a vice captain. It was then I realized, just becoming a Shinigami wasn't enough, I had to become one of the Elite, I had to be the best.</p>
<p>After graduating from the academy i was immediately drafted to 11th division and was almost given a seat except so many seated officers had their doubts with me being a new guy. not long after getting my seat in 11th division i decided that i need more power and left soul society to try and find a way into Hueco Mundo where i knew the strongest hollows were located. Not long after arriving in the real world i sensed a high reiatsu and followed it. This strange reiatsu lead me to Kisuke Urahara. After speaking to him he told me that he had a way to help me gain power before sending me to Hueco Mundo, which was to have me forcibly materialize my zanpakuto's spirit to achieve Bankai. He also warned that doing so could have serious side effects if i do not complete the training in time. I told him i was willing to do anything for the power and accepted the challenge and succeeded in only 4 hours. After achieving Bankai i rested up and departed to Hueco Mundo. While in Hueco Mundo i was easily taking out the hollows i ran into until i ran into a menos. During the fight with the menos i used my bankai and destroyed the hollow but in the process i alerted aizen and the arrancar of my position and was attacked by a low level arrancar who easily defeated me in my weakened state. after the fight i was left near death but alive and was almost consumed by a hollow until i fought it off and subdued it in my mind allowing me access to its powers. After this i returned to soul society and went to my division (11th) where i was then told by Zaraki Kenpachi that i was transferred to 14th division where i now sit comfortably in the third seat.</p>
