<p>&quot;We need to leave. Now.&quot;</p>
<p>The head of the MikuMiku's face darkens, she points at Smith - and her crew fly at him, with the snap-hiss of their weapons filling the air as they leap to the attack!</p>
<p>He defends himself with a pair of red and blue.. glowsticks?.. that are much more effective than they first appear. He drags your groggy form to the back of the auditorium, when an attack catches him off guard! He slumps, and one of the Douga stomps on you and lifts him, breathing in deeply as his essence flows to her..</p>
<p>Then he drops to the floor! The MikuMiku clutches her head, digital Code seeping from a wound! You see one of their number lock eyes with you, pocket a glowstick, then fade back into the crowd. A flash of recognition crosses your face..</p>
<p><strong><em>You've danced with her at the Rave.</em></strong> She applauded that one time you had that impressive performance. What's she doing here?</p>
<p>Smith recovers, grabs you, and escapes, as the doors close behind you, the screams of the crowd being drained muffled by the heavy doors.</p>

<p>Your gaze whirls around, as the MikuMiku all start to break apart, one by one, dissipating into the air. Rushing to the fallen glowsticks, you pick them up - only to find that you are holding the hands of your partner, sitting next to you!</p>
<p>&quot;We're free! We're all free! You'll see, now we can help!&quot; You start to ask what she means, but she's already explaining. &quot;We're the songs, the cores, of this world, and those in it.&quot; she points to one dissappearing Miku, and to someone in the audience. &quot;See? She is his. The will he's lost after being in this cycle for so long.&quot; He wakes with a start, looks around, then closes his eyes and breathes deeply, a sense of - wholeness? - passing over him.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm yours. You'll see. You'll see! I shouldn't even Be, but I am, and so are you! And she,&quot; pointing to the whirl of their fallen Leader,<br />
&quot;She's Hers. While He never lost his, She did. Now you should be able to hear both of them.. if you Listen. They aren't angels, they aren't devils, whispering in your ear. Feel those people, hear their voices - they are reaching out..&quot;</p>
<p>With that, she leans into you.. and vanishes.</p>
<p>You wake, along with everyone else, in a music hall. No one but you seems to have any idea how they got there, although, as they file out, people seem to be a lot more animated, talking about everything they suddenly remembered they have to do..</p>

<p>(having defeated the FutureMiku boss)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You file into a big auditorium, and wait for the show to start. Soon enough, the light dims, and cheers and glowsticks rise as the MikuMiku Douga appear in a flash of energy! Dressed in technological-looking, near identical clothing, differentiated only by hue, they march as one to center stage! Cheering, happy waving, idols and fans jumping around fill the hall, as the leader of them, your friend, struts forward, grabs her microphone, and raises her hand for silence, and begins to sing&#8230;</p>
<p>but somehow it's different now. The music relaxes and energizes people, with none of the strange gnawing of before. You note as you look around that everyone is both dancing to their own beat, but also tied together by a common Theme, something bigger than the room, the Con.. looking back at the stage, you and your friend lock eyes, letting space and time just disappear, and music fills your world..</p>
<p>Continue &gt;</p>
<p>As the concert ends, and you are filled with a calm quiet, and you can hear voices, deep within..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Insert one of several voices. See next tab for voices known so far.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It fades, and the hall is left empty, just you and your friend, as she reaches for your hand..</p>
<p><strong>+6 Sleep! +1 Cool! +5 Flow!</strong><br />
<strong>Long Dream usage reset!</strong><br />
Return to the Con &gt;</p>
